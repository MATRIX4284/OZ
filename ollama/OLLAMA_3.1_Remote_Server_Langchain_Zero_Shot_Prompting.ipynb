       "  'content': \"The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere**: When the sun shines, it sends out all kinds of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and infrared (IR) radiation.\\n2. **Light is scattered by gas molecules**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they scatter the light in all directions.\\n3. **Blue light is scattered more**: The shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, are scattered by the gas molecules even more efficiently than the longer wavelengths, such as red and orange. This is because the scattering effect increases with decreasing wavelength (or increasing frequency).\\n4. **Our eyes see the scattered blue light**: When we look at the sky, we see the blue light that has been scattered in all directions by the atmosphere. The blue color dominates our perception of the sky, giving it its characteristic blue appearance.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the exact shade of blue can vary depending on atmospheric conditions, such as:\\n\\n* **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.\\n* **Atmospheric pollution**: Tiny particles in polluted air can scatter light in a way that gives the sky a hazy or grayish appearance.\\n* **Clouds and fog**: When clouds or fog are present, they can reflect and absorb light, changing the apparent color of the sky.\\n\\nIn summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere, which favors shorter wavelengths like blue light.\"},\n",
