       "  'content': \"The sky appears blue to us because of a phenomenon called scattering, which occurs when sunlight interacts with the tiny molecules of gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n1. **Sunlight enters the atmosphere**: When the sun shines, it sends out a wide range of electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV) rays, and X-rays.\\n2. **Scattering occurs**: As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light, so they can scatter the light in all directions.\\n3. **Blue light is scattered more**: The shorter wavelengths of visible light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is because the tiny gas molecules are more effective at scattering the shorter wavelengths.\\n4. **Our eyes perceive the scattered light**: As a result of this scattering process, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere in all directions. When we look up at the sky, our eyes see this scattered blue light as the dominant color, giving the appearance of a blue sky.\\n\\nThis phenomenon is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's not just limited to the sky; you can also observe Rayleigh scattering in other situations, such as when light passes through a prism or a cloud.\\n\\nKeep in mind that this explanation is a simplified version of the complex processes involved. Other factors, like atmospheric conditions and pollution, can affect the color of the sky. But overall, the main reason for the blue sky is the scattering of sunlight by tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere!\"},\n",
