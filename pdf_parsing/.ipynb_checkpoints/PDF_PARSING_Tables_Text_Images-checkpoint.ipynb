      "How this book is organized: a roadmap\n",
      "This book has three parts that cover 18 chapters.\n",
      " Part 1 gives a short introduction to Docker and Kubernetes, how to set up a Kuber-\n",
      "netes cluster, and how to run a simple application in it. It contains two chapters:\n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 1 explains what Kubernetes is, how it came to be, and how it helps to\n",
      "solve today’s problems of managing applications at scale.\n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 2 is a hands-on tutorial on how to build a container image and run it in\n",
      "a Kubernetes cluster. It also explains how to run a local single-node Kubernetes\n",
      "cluster and a proper multi-node cluster in the cloud.\n",
      "Part 2 introduces the key concepts you must understand to run applications in Kuber-\n",
      "netes. The chapters are as follows:\n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 3 introduces the fundamental building block in Kubernetes—the pod—\n",
      "and explains how to organize pods and other Kubernetes objects through labels. \n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 4 teaches you how Kubernetes keeps applications healthy by automati-\n",
      "cally restarting containers. It also shows how to properly run managed pods,\n",
      "horizontally scale them, make them resistant to failures of cluster nodes, and\n",
      "run them at a predefined time in the future or periodically.\n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 5 shows how pods can expose the service they provide to clients run-\n",
      "ning both inside and outside the cluster. It also shows how pods running in the\n",
      "cluster can discover and access services, regardless of whether they live in or out\n",
      "of the cluster. \n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 6 explains how multiple containers running in the same pod can share\n",
      "files and how you can manage persistent storage and make it accessible to pods. \n",
      "■\n",
      "Chapter 7 shows how to pass configuration data and sensitive information like\n",
      "credentials to apps running inside pods.\n",

      "INTRODUCING THE MECHANISMS THAT MAKE CONTAINER ISOLATION POSSIBLE \n",
      "By this point, you’re probably wondering how exactly containers can isolate processes\n",
      "if they’re running on the same operating system. Two mechanisms make this possible.\n",
      "The first one, Linux Namespaces, makes sure each process sees its own personal view of\n",
      "the system (files, processes, network interfaces, hostname, and so on). The second\n",
      "one is Linux Control Groups (cgroups), which limit the amount of resources the process\n",
      "can consume (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and so on).\n",
      "ISOLATING PROCESSES WITH LINUX NAMESPACES\n",
      "By default, each Linux system initially has one single namespace. All system resources,\n",
      "such as filesystems, process IDs, user IDs, network interfaces, and others, belong to the\n",
      "single namespace. But you can create additional namespaces and organize resources\n",
      "across them. When running a process, you run it inside one of those namespaces. The\n",
      "process will only see resources that are inside the same namespace. Well, multiple\n",
      "kinds of namespaces exist, so a process doesn’t belong to one namespace, but to one\n",
      "namespace of each kind. \n",
      " The following kinds of namespaces exist:\n",
      "Mount (mnt)\n",
      "Process ID (pid)\n",
      "Network (net)\n",
      "Inter-process communication (ipc)\n",
      "UTS\n",
      "User ID (user)\n",
      "Each namespace kind is used to isolate a certain group of resources. For example, the\n",
      "UTS namespace determines what hostname and domain name the process running\n",
      "inside that namespace sees. By assigning two different UTS namespaces to a pair of\n",
      "processes, you can make them see different local hostnames. In other words, to the\n",
      "two processes, it will appear as though they are running on two different machines (at\n",
      "least as far as the hostname is concerned). \n",
      " Likewise, what Network namespace a process belongs to determines which net-\n",
      "work interfaces the application running inside the process sees. Each network inter-\n",
      "face belongs to exactly one namespace, but can be moved from one namespace to\n",
      "another. Each container uses its own Network namespace, and therefore each con-\n",
      "tainer sees its own set of network interfaces.\n",
      " This should give you a basic idea of how namespaces are used to isolate applica-\n",

      "LIMITING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO A PROCESS\n",

      "UNDERSTANDING THE OPERATION OF READINESS PROBES\n",
      "When a container is started, Kubernetes can be configured to wait for a configurable\n",
      "amount of time to pass before performing the first readiness check. After that, it\n",
      "invokes the probe periodically and acts based on the result of the readiness probe. If a\n",

      "restarted. This is an important distinction between liveness and readiness probes.\n",
      "Liveness probes keep pods healthy by killing off unhealthy containers and replacing\n",
      "them with new, healthy ones, whereas readiness probes make sure that only pods that\n",
      "are ready to serve requests receive them. This is mostly necessary during container\n",
      "start up, but it’s also useful after the container has been running for a while. \n",

      "(shown in figure 9.1).\n",
      "Initially, the pods run the first version of your application—let’s suppose its image is\n",

      "HOW THE DNS SERVER WORKS\n",
      "All the pods in the cluster are configured to use the cluster’s internal DNS server by\n",
      "default. This allows pods to easily look up services by name or even the pod’s IP\n",
      "addresses in the case of headless services.\n",
      " The DNS server pod is exposed through the kube-dns service, allowing the pod to\n",
      "be moved around the cluster, like any other pod. The service’s IP address is specified\n",
      "as the nameserver in the /etc/resolv.conf file inside every container deployed in the\n",
      "cluster. The kube-dns pod uses the API server’s watch mechanism to observe changes\n",
      "to Services and Endpoints and updates its DNS records with every change, allowing its\n",
      "clients to always get (fairly) up-to-date DNS information. I say fairly because during\n",
      "the time between the update of the Service or Endpoints resource and the time the\n",
      "DNS pod receives the watch notification, the DNS records may be invalid.\n",
      "HOW (MOST) INGRESS CONTROLLERS WORK\n",
      "Unlike the DNS add-on, you’ll find a few different implementations of Ingress con-\n",
      "trollers, but most of them work in the same way. An Ingress controller runs a reverse\n",
      "proxy server (like Nginx, for example), and keeps it configured according to the\n",
      "Ingress, Service, and Endpoints resources defined in the cluster. The controller thus\n",
      "needs to observe those resources (again, through the watch mechanism) and change\n",
      "the proxy server’s config every time one of them changes. \n",
      " Although the Ingress resource’s definition points to a Service, Ingress controllers\n",
      "forward traffic to the service’s pod directly instead of going through the service IP.\n",
      "This affects the preservation of client IPs when external clients connect through the\n",
      "Ingress controller, which makes them preferred over Services in certain use cases.\n",
      "USING OTHER ADD-ONS\n",
      "You’ve seen how both the DNS server and the Ingress controller add-ons are similar to\n",
      "the controllers running in the Controller Manager, except that they also accept client\n",
      "connections instead of only observing and modifying resources through the API server. \n",

      "address is virtual—it’s not assigned to any network interfaces and is never listed as\n",
      "either the source or the destination IP address in a network packet when the packet\n",
      "leaves the node. A key detail of Services is that they consist of an IP and port pair (or\n",
      "multiple IP and port pairs in the case of multi-port Services), so the service IP by itself\n",
      "doesn’t represent anything. That’s why you can’t ping them. \n",
      "11.5.2 How kube-proxy uses iptables\n",
      "When a service is created in the API server, the virtual IP address is assigned to it\n",
      "immediately. Soon afterward, the API server notifies all kube-proxy agents running on\n",
      "the worker nodes that a new Service has been created. Then, each kube-proxy makes\n",
      "that service addressable on the node it’s running on. It does this by setting up a few\n",
      "iptables rules, which make sure each packet destined for the service IP/port pair is\n",
      "intercepted and its destination address modified, so the packet is redirected to one of\n",
      "the pods backing the service. \n",
      " Besides watching the API server for changes to Services, kube-proxy also watches\n",

      "the service (an IP/port pair can also point to something other than a pod). That’s\n",
      "why the kube-proxy must also watch all Endpoints objects. After all, an Endpoints\n",

      "In the beginning of this chapter, you learned about the few components that make up\n",
      "a Kubernetes Control Plane. To make Kubernetes highly available, you need to run\n",
      "multiple master nodes, which run multiple instances of the following components:\n",

At that time, Kubernetes was still in its\\ninfancy—version 1.0 hadn’t even been released yet.\\n Our team had to get to know the ins and outs of Kubernetes quickly to set a proper\\ndirection for our software and take advantage of everything Kubernetes had to offer.\\nWhen faced with a problem, it was hard for us to tell if we were doing things wrong or\\nmerely hitting one of the early Kubernetes bugs. \\n Both Kubernetes and my understanding of it have come a long way since then.\\nWhen I first started using it, most people hadn’t even heard of Kubernetes. Now, virtu-\\nally every software engineer knows about it, and it has become one of the fastest-\\ngrowing and most-widely-adopted ways of running applications in both the cloud and\\non-premises datacenters. \\n In my first month of dealing with Kubernetes, I wrote a two-part blog post about\\nhow to run a JBoss WildFly application server cluster in OpenShift/Kubernetes. At the\\ntime, I never could have imagined that a simple blog post would ultimately lead the\\npeople at Manning to contact me about whether I would like to write a book about\\nKubernetes. Of course, I couldn’t say no to such an offer, even though I was sure\\nthey’d approached other people as well and would ultimately pick someone else.\\n And yet, here we are.

It teaches you\\nvirtually all the concepts you need to understand to effectively develop and run appli-\\ncations in a Kubernetes environment. \\n Before diving into Kubernetes, the book gives an overview of container technolo-\\ngies like Docker, including how to build containers, so that even readers who haven’t\\nused these technologies before can get up and running.  It then slowly guides you\\nthrough most of what you need to know about Kubernetes—from basic concepts to\\nthings hidden below the surface.\\nWho should read this book\\nThe book focuses primarily on application developers, but it also provides an overview\\nof managing applications from the operational perspective. It’s meant for anyone\\ninterested in running and managing containerized applications on more than just a\\nsingle server.\\n Both beginner and advanced software engineers who want to learn about con-\\ntainer technologies and orchestrating multiple related containers at scale will gain the\\nexpertise necessary to develop, containerize, and run their applications in a Kuberne-\\ntes environment. \\n No previous exposure to either container technologies or Kubernetes is required.\\nThe book explains the subject matter in a progressively detailed manner, and doesn’t\\nuse any application source code that would be too hard for non-expert developers to\\nunderstand. \\n \\n',\n",

It contains two chapters:\\n■\\nChapter 1 explains what Kubernetes is, how it came to be, and how it helps to\\nsolve today’s problems of managing applications at scale.\\n■\\nChapter 2 is a hands-on tutorial on how to build a container image and run it in\\na Kubernetes cluster. It also explains how to run a local single-node Kubernetes\\ncluster and a proper multi-node cluster in the cloud.\\nPart 2 introduces the key concepts you must understand to run applications in Kuber-\\nnetes. The chapters are as follows:\\n■\\nChapter 3 introduces the fundamental building block in Kubernetes—the pod—\\nand explains how to organize pods and other Kubernetes objects through labels. \\n■\\nChapter 4 teaches you how Kubernetes keeps applications healthy by automati-\\ncally restarting containers. It also shows how to properly run managed pods,\\nhorizontally scale them, make them resistant to failures of cluster nodes, and\\nrun them at a predefined time in the future or periodically.\\n■\\nChapter 5 shows how pods can expose the service they provide to clients run-\\nning both inside and outside the cluster. It also shows how pods running in the\\ncluster can discover and access services, regardless of whether they live in or out\\nof the cluster. \\n■\\nChapter 6 explains how multiple containers running in the same pod can share\\nfiles and how you can manage persistent storage and make it accessible to pods. \\n■\\nChapter 7 shows how to pass configuration data and sensitive information like\\ncredentials to apps running inside pods.\\n■\\nChapter 8 describes how applications can get information about the Kuberne-\\ntes environment they’re running in and how they can talk to Kubernetes to\\nalter the state of the cluster.\\n■\\nChapter 9 introduces the concept of a Deployment and explains the proper way\\nof running and updating applications in a Kubernetes environment.\\n■\\nChapter 10 introduces a dedicated way of running stateful applications, which\\nusually require a stable identity and state.\\nPart 3 dives deep into the internals of a Kubernetes cluster, introduces some addi-\\ntional concepts, and reviews everything you’ve learned in the first two parts from a\\nhigher perspective.

It\\nalso teaches you how to prevent users from consuming too many resources.\\n■\\nChapter 15 discusses how Kubernetes can be configured to automatically scale\\nthe number of running replicas of your application, and how it can also increase\\nthe size of your cluster when your current number of cluster nodes can’t accept\\nany additional applications. \\n■\\nChapter 16 shows how to ensure pods are scheduled only to certain nodes or\\nhow to prevent them from being scheduled to others. It also shows how to make\\nsure pods are scheduled together or how to prevent that from happening.\\n■\\nChapter 17 teaches you how you should develop your applications to make them\\ngood citizens of your cluster. It also gives you a few pointers on how to set up your\\ndevelopment and testing workflows to reduce friction during development.\\n■\\nChapter 18 shows you how you can extend Kubernetes with your own custom\\nobjects and how others have done it and created enterprise-class application\\nplatforms.\\nAs you progress through these chapters, you’ll not only learn about the individual\\nKubernetes building blocks, but also progressively improve your knowledge of using\\nthe kubectl command-line tool.\\nAbout the code\\nWhile this book doesn’t contain a lot of actual source code, it does contain a lot of\\nmanifests of Kubernetes resources in YAML format and shell commands along with\\ntheir outputs. All of this is formatted in a fixed-width font like this to separate it\\nfrom ordinary text. \\n Shell commands are mostly in bold, to clearly separate them from their output, but\\nsometimes only the most important parts of the command or parts of the command’s\\noutput are in bold for emphasis. In most cases, the command output has been reformat-\\nted to make it fit into the limited space in the book. Also, because the Kubernetes CLI\\ntool kubectl is constantly evolving, newer versions may print out more information\\nthan what’s shown in the book. Don’t be confused if they don’t match exactly. \\n Listings sometimes include a line-continuation marker (➥) to show that a line of\\ntext wraps to the next line.

The title page is missing from the collection and we have been\\nunable to track it down to date.

The Manning editor didn’t have on his person the substantial amount of cash\\nthat was required for the purchase, and a credit card and check were both politely\\nturned down.

It turned out to be nothing more than an old-\\nfashioned verbal agreement sealed with a handshake. The seller proposed that the\\nmoney be transferred to him by wire, and the editor walked out with the bank infor-\\nmation on a piece of paper and the portfolio of images under his arm.

This enables you to change components quickly and as often as\\nnecessary to keep up with today’s rapidly changing business requirements. \\n But with bigger numbers of deployable components and increasingly larger data-\\ncenters, it becomes increasingly difficult to configure, manage, and keep the whole\\nsystem running smoothly. It’s much harder to figure out where to put each of those\\ncomponents to achieve high resource utilization and thereby keep the hardware costs\\ndown. Doing all this manually is hard work. We need automation, which includes\\nautomatic scheduling of those components to our servers, automatic configuration,\\nsupervision, and failure-handling. This is where Kubernetes comes in.\\n Kubernetes enables developers to deploy their applications themselves and as\\noften as they want, without requiring any assistance from the operations (ops) team.\\nBut Kubernetes doesn’t benefit only developers. It also helps the ops team by automat-\\nically monitoring and rescheduling those apps in the event of a hardware failure. The\\nfocus for system administrators (sysadmins) shifts from supervising individual apps to\\nmostly supervising and managing Kubernetes and the rest of the infrastructure, while\\nKubernetes itself takes care of the apps. \\nNOTE\\nKubernetes is Greek for pilot or helmsman (the person holding the\\nship’s steering wheel). People pronounce Kubernetes in a few different ways.\\nMany pronounce it as Koo-ber-nay-tace, while others pronounce it more like\\nKoo-ber-netties. No matter which form you use, people will understand what\\nyou mean.\\nKubernetes abstracts away the hardware infrastructure and exposes your whole data-\\ncenter as a single enormous computational resource. It allows you to deploy and run\\nyour software components without having to know about the actual servers under-\\nneath. When deploying a multi-component application through Kubernetes, it selects\\na server for each component, deploys it, and enables it to easily find and communi-\\ncate with all the other components of your application. \\n This makes Kubernetes great for most on-premises datacenters, but where it starts\\nto shine is when it’s used in the largest datacenters, such as the ones built and oper-\\nated by cloud providers. Kubernetes allows them to offer developers a simple platform\\nfor deploying and running any type of application, while not requiring the cloud pro-\\nvider’s own sysadmins to know anything about the tens of thousands of apps running\\non their hardware. \\n With more and more big companies accepting the Kubernetes model as the best\\nway to run apps, it’s becoming the standard way of running distributed apps both in\\nthe cloud, as well as on local on-premises infrastructure. \\n1.1\\nUnderstanding the need for a system like Kubernetes \\nBefore you start getting to know Kubernetes in detail, let’s take a quick look at how\\nthe development and deployment of applications has changed in recent years.

Understanding these\\nchanges will help you better see the benefits of using Kubernetes and container tech-\\nnologies such as Docker.\\n1.1.1\\nMoving from monolithic apps to microservices\\nMonolithic applications consist of components that are all tightly coupled together and\\nhave to be developed, deployed, and managed as one entity, because they all run as a sin-\\ngle OS process. Changes to one part of the application require a redeployment of the\\nwhole application, and over time the lack of hard boundaries between the parts results\\nin the increase of complexity and consequential deterioration of the quality of the whole\\nsystem because of the unconstrained growth of inter-dependencies between these parts. \\n Running a monolithic application usually requires a small number of powerful\\nservers that can provide enough resources for running the application. To deal with\\nincreasing loads on the system, you then either have to vertically scale the servers (also\\nknown as scaling up) by adding more CPUs, memory, and other server components,\\nor scale the whole system horizontally, by setting up additional servers and running\\nmultiple copies (or replicas) of an application (scaling out). While scaling up usually\\ndoesn’t require any changes to the app, it gets expensive relatively quickly and in prac-\\ntice always has an upper limit. Scaling out, on the other hand, is relatively cheap hard-\\nware-wise, but may require big changes in the application code and isn’t always\\npossible—certain parts of an application are extremely hard or next to impossible to\\nscale horizontally (relational databases, for example). If any part of a monolithic\\napplication isn’t scalable, the whole application becomes unscalable, unless you can\\nsplit up the monolith somehow.\\nSPLITTING APPS INTO MICROSERVICES\\nThese and other problems have forced us to start splitting complex monolithic appli-\\ncations into smaller independently deployable components called microservices.

These\\nprotocols are simple, well understood by most developers, and not tied to any specific\\nprogramming language. Each microservice can be written in the language that’s most\\nappropriate for implementing that specific microservice.\\n Because each microservice is a standalone process with a relatively static external\\nAPI, it’s possible to develop and deploy each microservice separately.

Certain components are replicated and run as multiple\\nprocesses deployed on different servers, while others run as a single application process.\\nWhen a monolithic application can’t be scaled out because one of its parts is unscal-\\nable, splitting the app into microservices allows you to horizontally scale the parts that\\nallow scaling out, and scale the parts that don’t, vertically instead of horizontally.\\nServer 1\\nProcess 1.1\\nProcess 1.2\\nProcess 1.3\\nServer 2\\nProcess 2.1\\nProcess 2.2\\nServer 3\\nProcess 3.1\\nProcess 3.2\\nProcess 3.3\\nServer 4\\nProcess 4.1\\nProcess 4.2\\nProcess 2.3\\nSingle instance\\n(possibly not scalable)\\nThree instances of\\nthe same component\\nFigure 1.2\\nEach microservice can be scaled individually.\\n \\n',\n",

When your system consists of only a\\nsmall number of deployable components, managing those components is easy. It’s\\ntrivial to decide where to deploy each component, because there aren’t that many\\nchoices. When the number of those components increases, deployment-related deci-\\nsions become increasingly difficult because not only does the number of deployment\\ncombinations increase, but the number of inter-dependencies between the compo-\\nnents increases by an even greater factor. \\n Microservices perform their work together as a team, so they need to find and talk\\nto each other. When deploying them, someone or something needs to configure all of\\nthem properly to enable them to work together as a single system. With increasing\\nnumbers of microservices, this becomes tedious and error-prone, especially when you\\nconsider what the ops/sysadmin teams need to do when a server fails. \\n Microservices also bring other problems, such as making it hard to debug and trace\\nexecution calls, because they span multiple processes and machines. Luckily, these\\nproblems are now being addressed with distributed tracing systems such as Zipkin. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE DIVERGENCE OF ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS\\nAs I’ve already mentioned, components in a microservices architecture aren’t only\\ndeployed independently, but are also developed that way. Because of their indepen-\\ndence and the fact that it’s common to have separate teams developing each compo-\\nnent, nothing impedes each team from using different libraries and replacing them\\nwhenever the need arises.

Not only is there a\\nhuge difference between development and production environments, differences\\neven exist between individual production machines. Another unavoidable fact is that\\nthe environment of a single production machine will change over time. \\n These differences range from hardware to the operating system to the libraries\\nthat are available on each machine. Production environments are managed by the\\noperations team, while developers often take care of their development laptops on\\ntheir own. The difference is how much these two groups of people know about sys-\\ntem administration, and this understandably leads to relatively big differences\\nbetween those two systems, not to mention that system administrators give much more\\nemphasis on keeping the system up to date with the latest security patches, while a lot\\nof developers don’t care about that as much. \\n Also, production systems can run applications from multiple developers or devel-\\nopment teams, which isn’t necessarily true for developers’ computers. A production\\nsystem must provide the proper environment to all applications it hosts, even though\\nthey may require different, even conflicting, versions of libraries.\\n To reduce the number of problems that only show up in production, it would be\\nideal if applications could run in the exact same environment during development\\nand in production so they have the exact same operating system, libraries, system con-\\nfiguration, networking environment, and everything else. You also don’t want this\\nenvironment to change too much over time, if at all. Also, if possible, you want the\\nability to add applications to the same server without affecting any of the existing\\napplications on that server. \\n1.1.3\\nMoving to continuous delivery: DevOps and NoOps\\nIn the last few years, we’ve also seen a shift in the whole application development pro-\\ncess and how applications are taken care of in production. In the past, the develop-\\nment team’s job was to create the application and hand it off to the operations team,\\nwho then deployed it, tended to it, and kept it running. But now, organizations are\\nrealizing it’s better to have the same team that develops the application also take part\\nin deploying it and taking care of it over its whole lifetime. This means the developer,\\nQA, and operations teams now need to collaborate throughout the whole process.\\nThis practice is called DevOps.\\n \\n',\n",

Ideally, you want developers to deploy the applications them-\\nselves without having to wait for the ops people. But deploying an application often\\nrequires an understanding of the underlying infrastructure and the organization of\\nthe hardware in the datacenter. Developers don’t always know those details and, most\\nof the time, don’t even want to know about them. \\nLETTING DEVELOPERS AND SYSADMINS DO WHAT THEY DO BEST\\nEven though developers and system administrators both work toward achieving the\\nsame goal of running a successful software application as a service to its customers, they\\nhave different individual goals and motivating factors. Developers love creating new fea-\\ntures and improving the user experience. They don’t normally want to be the ones mak-\\ning sure that the underlying operating system is up to date with all the security patches\\nand things like that. They prefer to leave that up to the system administrators. \\n The ops team is in charge of the production deployments and the hardware infra-\\nstructure they run on. They care about system security, utilization, and other aspects\\nthat aren’t a high priority for developers. The ops people don’t want to deal with the\\nimplicit interdependencies of all the application components and don’t want to think\\nabout how changes to either the underlying operating system or the infrastructure\\ncan affect the operation of the application as a whole, but they must.\\n Ideally, you want the developers to deploy applications themselves without know-\\ning anything about the hardware infrastructure and without dealing with the ops\\nteam. This is referred to as NoOps. Obviously, you still need someone to take care of\\nthe hardware infrastructure, but ideally, without having to deal with peculiarities of\\neach application running on it. \\n As you’ll see, Kubernetes enables us to achieve all of this. By abstracting away the\\nactual hardware and exposing it as a single platform for deploying and running apps,\\nit allows developers to configure and deploy their applications without any help from\\nthe sysadmins and allows the sysadmins to focus on keeping the underlying infrastruc-\\nture up and running, while not having to know anything about the actual applications\\nrunning on top of it.\\n1.2\\nIntroducing container technologies\\nIn section 1.1 I presented a non-comprehensive list of problems facing today’s devel-\\nopment and ops teams.

But when these components start getting smaller and their\\nnumbers start to grow, you can’t give each of them their own VM if you don’t want to\\nwaste hardware resources and keep your hardware costs down. But it’s not only about\\nwasting hardware resources. Because each VM usually needs to be configured and\\nmanaged individually, rising numbers of VMs also lead to wasting human resources,\\nbecause they increase the system administrators’ workload considerably.\\nISOLATING COMPONENTS WITH LINUX CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES\\nInstead of using virtual machines to isolate the environments of each microservice (or\\nsoftware processes in general), developers are turning to Linux container technolo-\\ngies. They allow you to run multiple services on the same host machine, while not only\\nexposing a different environment to each of them, but also isolating them from each\\nother, similarly to VMs, but with much less overhead.\\n A process running in a container runs inside the host’s operating system, like all\\nthe other processes (unlike VMs, where processes run in separate operating sys-\\ntems). But the process in the container is still isolated from other processes. To the\\nprocess itself, it looks like it’s the only one running on the machine and in its oper-\\nating system. \\nCOMPARING VIRTUAL MACHINES TO CONTAINERS\\nCompared to VMs, containers are much more lightweight, which allows you to run\\nhigher numbers of software components on the same hardware, mainly because each\\nVM needs to run its own set of system processes, which requires additional compute\\nresources in addition to those consumed by the component’s own process. A con-\\ntainer, on the other hand, is nothing more than a single isolated process running in\\nthe host OS, consuming only the resources that the app consumes and without the\\noverhead of any additional processes. \\n Because of the overhead of VMs, you often end up grouping multiple applications\\ninto each VM because you don’t have enough resources to dedicate a whole VM to\\neach app. When using containers, you can (and should) have one container for each\\n \\n',\n",

Two mechanisms make this possible.\\nThe first one, Linux Namespaces, makes sure each process sees its own personal view of\\nthe system (files, processes, network interfaces, hostname, and so on). The second\\none is Linux Control Groups (cgroups), which limit the amount of resources the process\\ncan consume (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and so on).\\nISOLATING PROCESSES WITH LINUX NAMESPACES\\nBy default, each Linux system initially has one single namespace. All system resources,\\nsuch as filesystems, process IDs, user IDs, network interfaces, and others, belong to the\\nsingle namespace. But you can create additional namespaces and organize resources\\nacross them. When running a process, you run it inside one of those namespaces. The\\nprocess will only see resources that are inside the same namespace. Well, multiple\\nkinds of namespaces exist, so a process doesn’t belong to one namespace, but to one\\nnamespace of each kind. \\n The following kinds of namespaces exist:\\n\\uf0a1Mount (mnt)\\n\\uf0a1Process ID (pid)\\n\\uf0a1Network (net)\\n\\uf0a1Inter-process communication (ipc)\\n\\uf0a1UTS\\n\\uf0a1User ID (user)\\nEach namespace kind is used to isolate a certain group of resources. For example, the\\nUTS namespace determines what hostname and domain name the process running\\ninside that namespace sees. By assigning two different UTS namespaces to a pair of\\nprocesses, you can make them see different local hostnames. In other words, to the\\ntwo processes, it will appear as though they are running on two different machines (at\\nleast as far as the hostname is concerned). \\n Likewise, what Network namespace a process belongs to determines which net-\\nwork interfaces the application running inside the process sees. Each network inter-\\nface belongs to exactly one namespace, but can be moved from one namespace to\\nanother. Each container uses its own Network namespace, and therefore each con-\\ntainer sees its own set of network interfaces.\\n This should give you a basic idea of how namespaces are used to isolate applica-\\ntions running in containers from each other. \\nLIMITING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO A PROCESS\\nThe other half of container isolation deals with limiting the amount of system\\nresources a container can consume. This is achieved with cgroups, a Linux kernel fea-\\nture that limits the resource usage of a process (or a group of processes). A process\\ncan’t use more than the configured amount of CPU, memory, network bandwidth,\\n \\n',\n",

This way, processes cannot hog resources reserved for other processes,\\nwhich is similar to when each process runs on a separate machine.\\n1.2.2\\nIntroducing the Docker container platform\\nWhile container technologies have been around for a long time, they’ve become\\nmore widely known with the rise of the Docker container platform. Docker was the\\nfirst container system that made containers easily portable across different machines.\\nIt simplified the process of packaging up not only the application but also all its\\nlibraries and other dependencies, even the whole OS file system, into a simple, por-\\ntable package that can be used to provision the application to any other machine\\nrunning Docker. \\n When you run an application packaged with Docker, it sees the exact filesystem\\ncontents that you’ve bundled with it. It sees the same files whether it’s running on\\nyour development machine or a production machine, even if it the production server\\nis running a completely different Linux OS. The application won’t see anything from\\nthe server it’s running on, so it doesn’t matter if the server has a completely different\\nset of installed libraries compared to your development machine. \\n For example, if you’ve packaged up your application with the files of the whole\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system, the application will believe it’s\\nrunning inside RHEL, both when you run it on your development computer that runs\\nFedora and when you run it on a server running Debian or some other Linux distribu-\\ntion. Only the kernel may be different.\\n This is similar to creating a VM image by installing an operating system into a VM,\\ninstalling the app inside it, and then distributing the whole VM image around and\\nrunning it. Docker achieves the same effect, but instead of using VMs to achieve app\\nisolation, it uses Linux container technologies mentioned in the previous section to\\nprovide (almost) the same level of isolation that VMs do. Instead of using big mono-\\nlithic VM images, it uses container images, which are usually smaller.\\n A big difference between Docker-based container images and VM images is that\\ncontainer images are composed of layers, which can be shared and reused across mul-\\ntiple images. This means only certain layers of an image need to be downloaded if the\\nother layers were already downloaded previously when running a different container\\nimage that also contains the same layers.\\nUNDERSTANDING DOCKER CONCEPTS\\nDocker is a platform for packaging, distributing, and running applications. As we’ve\\nalready stated, it allows you to package your application together with its whole envi-\\nronment. This can be either a few libraries that the app requires or even all the files\\nthat are usually available on the filesystem of an installed operating system. Docker\\nmakes it possible to transfer this package to a central repository from which it can\\nthen be transferred to any computer running Docker and executed there (for the\\nmost part, but not always, as we’ll soon explain).\\n \\n',\n",

Certain registries are pub-\\nlic, allowing anyone to pull images from it, while others are private, only accessi-\\nble to certain people or machines.\\n\\uf0a1Containers—A Docker-based container is a regular Linux container created from\\na Docker-based container image. A running container is a process running on\\nthe host running Docker, but it’s completely isolated from both the host and all\\nother processes running on it. The process is also resource-constrained, mean-\\ning it can only access and use the amount of resources (CPU, RAM, and so on)\\nthat are allocated to it. \\nBUILDING, DISTRIBUTING, AND RUNNING A DOCKER IMAGE\\nFigure 1.6 shows all three concepts and how they relate to each other. The developer\\nfirst builds an image and then pushes it to a registry. The image is thus available to\\nanyone who can access the registry. They can then pull the image to any other\\nmachine running Docker and run the image.

How can both app A and app B\\nshare the same files?\\nUNDERSTANDING IMAGE LAYERS\\nI’ve already said that Docker images are composed of layers. Different images can con-\\ntain the exact same layers because every Docker image is built on top of another\\nimage and two different images can both use the same parent image as their base.\\nThis speeds up the distribution of images across the network, because layers that have\\nalready been transferred as part of the first image don’t need to be transferred again\\nwhen transferring the other image. \\n But layers don’t only make distribution more efficient, they also help reduce the\\nstorage footprint of images. Each layer is only stored once. Two containers created\\nfrom two images based on the same base layers can therefore read the same files, but\\nif one of them writes over those files, the other one doesn’t see those changes. There-\\nfore, even if they share files, they’re still isolated from each other. This works because\\ncontainer image layers are read-only. When a container is run, a new writable layer is\\ncreated on top of the layers in the image. When the process in the container writes to\\na file located in one of the underlying layers, a copy of the whole file is created in the\\ntop-most layer and the process writes to the copy. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE PORTABILITY LIMITATIONS OF CONTAINER IMAGES\\nIn theory, a container image can be run on any Linux machine running Docker, but\\none small caveat exists—one related to the fact that all containers running on a host use\\nthe host’s Linux kernel. If a containerized application requires a specific kernel version,\\nit may not work on every machine. If a machine runs a different version of the Linux\\nkernel or doesn’t have the same kernel modules available, the app can’t run on it.\\n While containers are much more lightweight compared to VMs, they impose cer-\\ntain constraints on the apps running inside them. VMs have no such constraints,\\nbecause each VM runs its own kernel. \\n And it’s not only about the kernel. It should also be clear that a containerized app\\nbuilt for a specific hardware architecture can only run on other machines that have\\nthe same architecture. You can’t containerize an application built for the x86 architec-\\nture and expect it to run on an ARM-based machine because it also runs Docker. You\\nstill need a VM for that.\\n1.2.3\\nIntroducing rkt—an alternative to Docker\\nDocker was the first container platform that made containers mainstream. I hope I’ve\\nmade it clear that Docker itself doesn’t provide process isolation. The actual isolation\\nof containers is done at the Linux kernel level using kernel features such as Linux\\nNamespaces and cgroups. Docker only makes it easy to use those features.\\n After the success of Docker, the Open Container Initiative (OCI) was born to cre-\\nate open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Docker is part\\nof that initiative, as is rkt (pronounced “rock-it”), which is another Linux container\\nengine. \\n \\n',\n",

It puts a strong emphasis on\\nsecurity, composability, and conforming to open standards. It uses the OCI container\\nimage format and can even run regular Docker container images. \\n This book focuses on using Docker as the container runtime for Kubernetes,\\nbecause it was initially the only one supported by Kubernetes. Recently, Kubernetes\\nhas also started supporting rkt, as well as others, as the container runtime. \\n The reason I mention rkt at this point is so you don’t make the mistake of thinking\\nKubernetes is a container orchestration system made specifically for Docker-based\\ncontainers. In fact, over the course of this book, you’ll realize that the essence of\\nKubernetes isn’t orchestrating containers. It’s much more. Containers happen to be\\nthe best way to run apps on different cluster nodes. With that in mind, let’s finally dive\\ninto the core of what this book is all about—Kubernetes.\\n1.3\\nIntroducing Kubernetes\\nWe’ve already shown that as the number of deployable application components in\\nyour system grows, it becomes harder to manage them all. Google was probably the\\nfirst company that realized it needed a much better way of deploying and managing\\ntheir software components and their infrastructure to scale globally. It’s one of only a\\nfew companies in the world that runs hundreds of thousands of servers and has had to\\ndeal with managing deployments on such a massive scale. This has forced them to\\ndevelop solutions for making the development and deployment of thousands of soft-\\nware components manageable and cost-efficient.\\n1.3.1\\nUnderstanding its origins\\nThrough the years, Google developed an internal system called Borg (and later a new\\nsystem called Omega), that helped both application developers and system administra-\\ntors manage those thousands of applications and services. In addition to simplifying\\nthe development and management, it also helped them achieve a much higher utiliza-\\ntion of their infrastructure, which is important when your organization is that large.\\nWhen you run hundreds of thousands of machines, even tiny improvements in utiliza-\\ntion mean savings in the millions of dollars, so the incentives for developing such a\\nsystem are clear.\\n After having kept Borg and Omega secret for a whole decade, in 2014 Google\\nintroduced Kubernetes, an open-source system based on the experience gained\\nthrough Borg, Omega, and other internal Google systems. \\n1.3.2\\nLooking at Kubernetes from the top of a mountain\\nKubernetes is a software system that allows you to easily deploy and manage container-\\nized applications on top of it. It relies on the features of Linux containers to run het-\\nerogeneous applications without having to know any internal details of these\\napplications and without having to manually deploy these applications on each host.\\nBecause these apps run in containers, they don’t affect other apps running on the\\n \\n',\n",

This is of paramount importance for cloud provid-\\ners, because they strive for the best possible utilization of their hardware while still\\nhaving to maintain complete isolation of hosted applications.\\n Kubernetes enables you to run your software applications on thousands of com-\\nputer nodes as if all those nodes were a single, enormous computer. It abstracts away\\nthe underlying infrastructure and, by doing so, simplifies development, deployment,\\nand management for both development and the operations teams. \\n Deploying applications through Kubernetes is always the same, whether your clus-\\nter contains only a couple of nodes or thousands of them. The size of the cluster\\nmakes no difference at all. Additional cluster nodes simply represent an additional\\namount of resources available to deployed apps.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE CORE OF WHAT KUBERNETES DOES\\nFigure 1.8 shows the simplest possible view of a Kubernetes system. The system is com-\\nposed of a master node and any number of worker nodes. When the developer sub-\\nmits a list of apps to the master, Kubernetes deploys them to the cluster of worker\\nnodes. What node a component lands on doesn’t (and shouldn’t) matter—neither to\\nthe developer nor to the system administrator.\\nThe developer can specify that certain apps must run together and Kubernetes will\\ndeploy them on the same worker node. Others will be spread around the cluster, but\\nthey can talk to each other in the same way, regardless of where they’re deployed.\\nHELPING DEVELOPERS FOCUS ON THE CORE APP FEATURES\\nKubernetes can be thought of as an operating system for the cluster. It relieves appli-\\ncation developers from having to implement certain infrastructure-related services\\ninto their apps; instead they rely on Kubernetes to provide these services.

If one of those instances stops working\\nproperly, like when its process crashes or when it stops responding, Kubernetes will\\nrestart it automatically. \\n Similarly, if a whole worker node dies or becomes inaccessible, Kubernetes will\\nselect new nodes for all the containers that were running on the node and run them\\non the newly selected nodes.\\nSCALING THE NUMBER OF COPIES\\nWhile the application is running, you can decide you want to increase or decrease the\\nnumber of copies, and Kubernetes will spin up additional ones or stop the excess\\nones, respectively. You can even leave the job of deciding the optimal number of cop-\\nies to Kubernetes. It can automatically keep adjusting the number, based on real-time\\nmetrics, such as CPU load, memory consumption, queries per second, or any other\\nmetric your app exposes. \\nHITTING A MOVING TARGET\\nWe’ve said that Kubernetes may need to move your containers around the cluster.\\nThis can occur when the node they were running on has failed or because they were\\nevicted from a node to make room for other containers. If the container is providing a\\nservice to external clients or other containers running in the cluster, how can they use\\nthe container properly if it’s constantly moving around the cluster? And how can cli-\\nents connect to containers providing a service when those containers are replicated\\nand spread across the whole cluster?\\n To allow clients to easily find containers that provide a specific service, you can tell\\nKubernetes which containers provide the same service and Kubernetes will expose all\\nof them at a single static IP address and expose that address to all applications run-\\nning in the cluster. This is done through environment variables, but clients can also\\nlook up the service IP through good old DNS. The kube-proxy will make sure connec-\\ntions to the service are load balanced across all the containers that provide the service.\\nThe IP address of the service stays constant, so clients can always connect to its con-\\ntainers, even when they’re moved around the cluster.\\n1.3.5\\nUnderstanding the benefits of using Kubernetes\\nIf you have Kubernetes deployed on all your servers, the ops team doesn’t need to\\ndeal with deploying your apps anymore. Because a containerized application already\\ncontains all it needs to run, the system administrators don’t need to install anything to\\ndeploy and run the app. On any node where Kubernetes is deployed, Kubernetes can\\nrun the app immediately without any help from the sysadmins. \\nSIMPLIFYING APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT\\nBecause Kubernetes exposes all its worker nodes as a single deployment platform,\\napplication developers can start deploying applications on their own and don’t need\\nto know anything about the servers that make up the cluster. \\n \\n',\n",

A developer doesn’t usually care what\\nkind of server the application is running on, as long as the server can provide the\\napplication with adequate system resources. \\n Certain cases do exist where the developer does care what kind of hardware the\\napplication should run on. If the nodes are heterogeneous, you’ll find cases when you\\nwant certain apps to run on nodes with certain capabilities and run other apps on oth-\\ners. For example, one of your apps may require being run on a system with SSDs\\ninstead of HDDs, while other apps run fine on HDDs. In such cases, you obviously\\nwant to ensure that particular app is always scheduled to a node with an SSD.\\n Without using Kubernetes, the sysadmin would select one specific node that has an\\nSSD and deploy the app there. But when using Kubernetes, instead of selecting a spe-\\ncific node where your app should be run, it’s more appropriate to tell Kubernetes to\\nonly choose among nodes with an SSD. You’ll learn how to do that in chapter 3.\\nACHIEVING BETTER UTILIZATION OF HARDWARE\\nBy setting up Kubernetes on your servers and using it to run your apps instead of run-\\nning them manually, you’ve decoupled your app from the infrastructure. When you\\ntell Kubernetes to run your application, you’re letting it choose the most appropriate\\nnode to run your application on based on the description of the application’s\\nresource requirements and the available resources on each node. \\n By using containers and not tying the app down to a specific node in your cluster,\\nyou’re allowing the app to freely move around the cluster at any time, so the different\\napp components running on the cluster can be mixed and matched to be packed\\ntightly onto the cluster nodes. This ensures the node’s hardware resources are utilized\\nas best as possible.\\n The ability to move applications around the cluster at any time allows Kubernetes\\nto utilize the infrastructure much better than what you can achieve manually. Humans\\naren’t good at finding optimal combinations, especially when the number of all possi-\\nble options is huge, such as when you have many application components and many\\nserver nodes they can be deployed on. Computers can obviously perform this work\\nmuch better and faster than humans. \\nHEALTH CHECKING AND SELF-HEALING\\nHaving a system that allows moving an application across the cluster at any time is also\\nvaluable in the event of server failures. As your cluster size increases, you’ll deal with\\nfailing computer components ever more frequently. \\n Kubernetes monitors your app components and the nodes they run on and auto-\\nmatically reschedules them to other nodes in the event of a node failure. This frees\\nthe ops team from having to migrate app components manually and allows the team\\nto immediately focus on fixing the node itself and returning it to the pool of available\\nhardware resources instead of focusing on relocating the app.\\n If your infrastructure has enough spare resources to allow normal system opera-\\ntion even without the failed node, the ops team doesn’t even need to react to the failure\\n \\n',\n",

As previously mentioned, Kubernetes can be told to monitor the\\nresources used by each application and to keep adjusting the number of running\\ninstances of each application. \\n If Kubernetes is running on cloud infrastructure, where adding additional nodes is\\nas easy as requesting them through the cloud provider’s API, Kubernetes can even\\nautomatically scale the whole cluster size up or down based on the needs of the\\ndeployed applications.\\nSIMPLIFYING APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT\\nThe features described in the previous section mostly benefit the operations team. But\\nwhat about the developers? Does Kubernetes bring anything to their table? It defi-\\nnitely does.\\n If you turn back to the fact that apps run in the same environment both during\\ndevelopment and in production, this has a big effect on when bugs are discovered. We\\nall agree the sooner you discover a bug, the easier it is to fix it, and fixing it requires\\nless work. It’s the developers who do the fixing, so this means less work for them. \\n Then there’s the fact that developers don’t need to implement features that they\\nwould usually implement. This includes discovery of services and/or peers in a clustered\\napplication. Kubernetes does this instead of the app. Usually, the app only needs to look\\nup certain environment variables or perform a DNS lookup. If that’s not enough, the\\napplication can query the Kubernetes API server directly to get that and/or other infor-\\nmation. Querying the Kubernetes API server like that can even save developers from\\nhaving to implement complicated mechanisms such as leader election.\\n As a final example of what Kubernetes brings to the table, you also need to con-\\nsider the increase in confidence developers will feel knowing that when a new version\\nof their app is going to be rolled out, Kubernetes can automatically detect if the new\\nversion is bad and stop its rollout immediately. This increase in confidence usually\\naccelerates the continuous delivery of apps, which benefits the whole organization.\\n1.4\\nSummary\\nIn this introductory chapter, you’ve seen how applications have changed in recent\\nyears and how they can now be harder to deploy and manage. We’ve introduced\\nKubernetes and shown how it, together with Docker and other container platforms,\\nhelps deploy and manage applications and the infrastructure they run on.

We’ll do a basic introduction to\\nusing Docker in case you haven’t used it yet. In the next few sections you’ll\\n1\\nInstall Docker and run your first “Hello world” container \\n2\\nCreate a trivial Node.js app that you’ll later deploy in Kubernetes\\n3\\nPackage the app into a container image so you can then run it as an isolated\\ncontainer\\n4\\nRun a container based on the image\\n5\\nPush the image to Docker Hub so that anyone anywhere can run it\\n2.1.1\\nInstalling Docker and running a Hello World container\\nFirst, you’ll need to install Docker on your Linux machine. If you don’t use Linux,\\nyou’ll need to start a Linux virtual machine (VM) and run Docker inside that VM. If\\nyou’re using a Mac or Windows and install Docker per instructions, Docker will set up\\na VM for you and run the Docker daemon inside that VM. The Docker client execut-\\nable will be available on your host OS, and will communicate with the daemon inside\\nthe VM. \\n To install Docker, follow the instructions at http:/\\n/docs.docker.com/engine/\\ninstallation/ for your specific operating system. After completing the installation, you\\ncan use the Docker client executable to run various Docker commands. For example,\\nyou could try pulling and running an existing image from Docker Hub, the public\\nDocker registry, which contains ready-to-use container images for many well-known\\nsoftware packages. One of them is the busybox image, which you’ll use to run a simple\\necho \"Hello world\" command. \\nRUNNING A HELLO WORLD CONTAINER\\nIf you’re unfamiliar with busybox, it’s a single executable that combines many of the\\nstandard UNIX command-line tools, such as echo, ls, gzip, and so on. Instead of the\\nbusybox image, you could also use any other full-fledged OS container image such as\\nFedora, Ubuntu, or other similar images, as long as it includes the echo executable.\\n How do you run the busybox image? You don’t need to download or install any-\\nthing. Use the docker run command and specify what image to download and run\\nand (optionally) what command to execute, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ docker run busybox echo \"Hello world\"\\nUnable to find image \\'busybox:latest\\' locally\\nlatest: Pulling from docker.io/busybox\\n9a163e0b8d13: Pull complete \\nfef924a0204a: Pull complete\\nDigest: sha256:97473e34e311e6c1b3f61f2a721d038d1e5eef17d98d1353a513007cf46ca6bd\\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for docker.io/busybox:latest\\nHello world\\nListing 2.1\\nRunning a Hello world container with Docker\\n \\n',\n",

In your case, the app was a single execut-\\nable (busybox), but it might as well have been an incredibly complex app with many\\ndependencies. The whole process of setting up and running the app would have been\\nexactly the same. What’s also important is that the app was executed inside a container,\\ncompletely isolated from all the other processes running on your machine.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES\\nFigure 2.1 shows exactly what happened when you performed the docker run com-\\nmand. First, Docker checked to see if the busybox:latest image was already present\\non your local machine. It wasn’t, so Docker pulled it from the Docker Hub registry at\\nhttp:/\\n/docker.io. After the image was downloaded to your machine, Docker created a\\ncontainer from that image and ran the command inside it. The echo command\\nprinted the text to STDOUT and then the process terminated and the container\\nstopped.\\nRUNNING OTHER IMAGES\\nRunning other existing container images is much the same as how you ran the busybox\\nimage. In fact, it’s often even simpler, because you usually don’t need to specify what\\ncommand to execute, the way you did in the example (echo \"Hello world\"). The\\ncommand that should be executed is usually baked into the image itself, but you can\\noverride it if you want. After searching or browsing through the publicly available\\nimages on http:/\\n/hub.docker.com or another public registry, you tell Docker to run\\nthe image like this:\\n$ docker run <image>\\nFigure 2.1\\nRunning echo “Hello world” in a container based on the busybox container image\\nLocal machine\\nDocker Hub\\n1. docker run busybox\\necho \"Hello world\"\\n3.

Docker supports having multiple versions or variants of the same image under\\nthe same name. Each variant must have a unique tag. When referring to images with-\\nout explicitly specifying the tag, Docker will assume you’re referring to the so-called\\nlatest tag. To run a different version of the image, you may specify the tag along with\\nthe image name like this:\\n$ docker run <image>:<tag>\\n2.1.2\\nCreating a trivial Node.js app\\nNow that you have a working Docker setup, you’re going to create an app. You’ll build\\na trivial Node.js web application and package it into a container image. The applica-\\ntion will accept HTTP requests and respond with the hostname of the machine it’s\\nrunning in. This way, you’ll see that an app running inside a container sees its own\\nhostname and not that of the host machine, even though it’s running on the host like\\nany other process. This will be useful later, when you deploy the app on Kubernetes\\nand scale it out (scale it horizontally; that is, run multiple instances of the app). You’ll\\nsee your HTTP requests hitting different instances of the app.\\n Your app will consist of a single file called app.js with the contents shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\nconst http = require(\\'http\\');\\nconst os = require(\\'os\\');\\nconsole.log(\"Kubia server starting...\");\\nvar handler = function(request, response) {\\n  console.log(\"Received request from \" + request.connection.remoteAddress);\\n  response.writeHead(200);\\n  response.end(\"You\\'ve hit \" + os.hostname() + \"\\\\n\");\\n};\\nvar www = http.createServer(handler);\\nwww.listen(8080);\\nIt should be clear what this code does. It starts up an HTTP server on port 8080. The\\nserver responds with an HTTP response status code 200 OK and the text \"You’ve hit\\n<hostname>\" to every request. The request handler also logs the client’s IP address to\\nthe standard output, which you’ll need later.\\nNOTE\\nThe returned hostname is the server’s actual hostname, not the one\\nthe client sends in the HTTP request’s Host header.\\nYou could now download and install Node.js and test your app directly, but this isn’t\\nnecessary, because you’ll use Docker to package the app into a container image and\\nListing 2.2\\nA simple Node.js app: app.js\\n \\n',\n",

The Dockerfile needs to be in the same directory as the app.js file and should\\ncontain the commands shown in the following listing.\\nFROM node:7\\nADD app.js /app.js\\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\\nThe FROM line defines the container image you’ll use as a starting point (the base\\nimage you’re building on top of). In your case, you’re using the node container image,\\ntag 7. In the second line, you’re adding your app.js file from your local directory into\\nthe root directory in the image, under the same name (app.js). Finally, in the third\\nline, you’re defining what command should be executed when somebody runs the\\nimage. In your case, the command is node app.js.\\n2.1.4\\nBuilding the container image\\nNow that you have your Dockerfile and the app.js file, you have everything you need\\nto build your image. To build it, run the following Docker command:\\n$ docker build -t kubia .\\nFigure 2.2 shows what happens during the build process. You’re telling Docker to\\nbuild an image called kubia based on the contents of the current directory (note the\\ndot at the end of the build command). Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the direc-\\ntory and build the image based on the instructions in the file.\\nListing 2.3\\nA Dockerfile for building a container image for your app\\nChoosing a base image\\nYou may wonder why we chose this specific image as your base. Because your app\\nis a Node.js app, you need your image to contain the node binary executable to run\\nthe app. You could have used any image that contains that binary, or you could have\\neven used a Linux distro base image such as fedora or ubuntu and installed\\nNode.js into the container at image build time. But because the node image is made\\nspecifically for running Node.js apps, and includes everything you need to run your\\napp, you’ll use that as the base image.\\n \\n',\n",

Instead, the contents of the\\nwhole directory are uploaded to the Docker daemon and the image is built there.\\nThe client and daemon don’t need to be on the same machine at all. If you’re using\\nDocker on a non-Linux OS, the client is on your host OS, but the daemon runs\\ninside a VM. Because all the files in the build directory are uploaded to the daemon,\\nif it contains many large files and the daemon isn’t running locally, the upload may\\ntake longer. \\nTIP\\nDon’t include any unnecessary files in the build directory, because they’ll\\nslow down the build process—especially when the Docker daemon is on a\\nremote machine. \\nDuring the build process, Docker will first pull the base image (node:7) from the pub-\\nlic image repository (Docker Hub), unless the image has already been pulled and is\\nstored on your machine. \\nUNDERSTANDING IMAGE LAYERS\\nAn image isn’t a single, big, binary blob, but is composed of multiple layers, which you\\nmay have already noticed when running the busybox example (there were multiple\\nPull complete lines—one for each layer). Different images may share several layers,\\nFigure 2.2\\nBuilding a new container image from a Dockerfile\\nLocal machine\\nDocker Hub\\n1. docker build\\nkubia .\\n3.

For example, if\\nyou create multiple images based on the same base image (such as node:7 in the exam-\\nple), all the layers comprising the base image will be stored only once. Also, when pull-\\ning an image, Docker will download each layer individually. Several layers may already\\nbe stored on your machine, so Docker will only download those that aren’t.\\n You may think that each Dockerfile creates only a single new layer, but that’s not\\nthe case. When building an image, a new layer is created for each individual command\\nin the Dockerfile. During the build of your image, after pulling all the layers of the base\\nimage, Docker will create a new layer on top of them and add the app.js file into it.\\nThen it will create yet another layer that will specify the command that should be exe-\\ncuted when the image is run. This last layer will then be tagged as kubia:latest. This is\\nshown in figure 2.3, which also shows how a different image called other:latest would\\nuse the same layers of the Node.js image as your own image does.\\nWhen the build process completes, you have a new image stored locally.

You can even run a shell, provided that the\\nshell’s binary executable is available in the image. \\nRUNNING A SHELL INSIDE AN EXISTING CONTAINER\\nThe Node.js image on which you’ve based your image contains the bash shell, so you\\ncan run the shell inside the container like this:\\n$ docker exec -it kubia-container bash\\nThis will run bash inside the existing kubia-container container. The bash process\\nwill have the same Linux namespaces as the main container process. This allows you\\nto explore the container from within and see how Node.js and your app see the system\\nwhen running inside the container. The -it option is shorthand for two options: \\n\\uf0a1\\n-i, which makes sure STDIN is kept open. You need this for entering com-\\nmands into the shell. \\n\\uf0a1\\n-t, which allocates a pseudo terminal (TTY).\\nYou need both if you want the use the shell like you’re used to. (If you leave out the\\nfirst one, you can’t type any commands, and if you leave out the second one, the com-\\nmand prompt won’t be displayed and some commands will complain about the TERM\\nvariable not being set.)\\nEXPLORING THE CONTAINER FROM WITHIN\\nLet’s see how to use the shell in the following listing to see the processes running in\\nthe container.\\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ps aux\\nUSER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND\\nroot    1  0.0  0.1 676380 16504 ?

If you\\nhave a keen eye, you may have noticed that the processes have different IDs inside the\\ncontainer vs. on the host. The container is using its own PID Linux namespace and\\nhas a completely isolated process tree, with its own sequence of numbers. \\nTHE CONTAINER’S FILESYSTEM IS ALSO ISOLATED\\nLike having an isolated process tree, each container also has an isolated filesystem.\\nListing the contents of the root directory inside the container will only show the files\\nin the container and will include all the files that are in the image plus any files that\\nare created while the container is running (log files and similar), as shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ls /\\napp.js  boot  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr\\nbin     dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var\\nIt contains the app.js file and other system directories that are part of the node:7 base\\nimage you’re using. To exit the container, you exit the shell by running the exit com-\\nmand and you’ll be returned to your host machine (like logging out of an ssh session,\\nfor example).\\nTIP\\nEntering a running container like this is useful when debugging an app\\nrunning in a container. When something’s wrong, the first thing you’ll want\\nto explore is the actual state of the system your application sees. Keep in mind\\nthat an application will not only see its own unique filesystem, but also pro-\\ncesses, users, hostname, and network interfaces.\\n2.1.7\\nStopping and removing a container\\nTo stop your app, you tell Docker to stop the kubia-container container:\\n$ docker stop kubia-container\\nListing 2.7\\nA container’s processes run in the host OS\\nListing 2.8\\nA container has its own complete filesystem\\n \\n',\n",

The con-\\ntainer itself still exists and you can see it with docker ps -a. The -a option prints out\\nall the containers, those running and those that have been stopped. To truly remove a\\ncontainer, you need to remove it with the docker rm command:\\n$ docker rm kubia-container\\nThis deletes the container. All its contents are removed and it can’t be started again.\\n2.1.8\\nPushing the image to an image registry\\nThe image you’ve built has so far only been available on your local machine. To allow\\nyou to run it on any other machine, you need to push the image to an external image\\nregistry. For the sake of simplicity, you won’t set up a private image registry and will\\ninstead push the image to Docker Hub (http:/\\n/hub.docker.com), which is one of the\\npublicly available registries. Other widely used such registries are Quay.io and the\\nGoogle Container Registry.\\n Before you do that, you need to re-tag your image according to Docker Hub’s\\nrules. Docker Hub will allow you to push an image if the image’s repository name\\nstarts with your Docker Hub ID. You create your Docker Hub ID by registering at\\nhttp:/\\n/hub.docker.com. I’ll use my own ID (luksa) in the following examples. Please\\nchange every occurrence with your own ID.\\nTAGGING AN IMAGE UNDER AN ADDITIONAL TAG\\nOnce you know your ID, you’re ready to rename your image, currently tagged as\\nkubia, to luksa/kubia (replace luksa with your own Docker Hub ID):\\n$ docker tag kubia luksa/kubia\\nThis doesn’t rename the tag; it creates an additional tag for the same image. You can\\nconfirm this by listing the images stored on your system with the docker images com-\\nmand, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ docker images | head\\nREPOSITORY        TAG      IMAGE ID        CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE\\nluksa/kubia       latest   d30ecc7419e7    About an hour ago   654.5 MB\\nkubia             latest   d30ecc7419e7    About an hour ago   654.5 MB\\ndocker.io/node    7.0      04c0ca2a8dad    2 days ago          654.5 MB\\n...\\nAs you can see, both kubia and luksa/kubia point to the same image ID, so they’re in\\nfact one single image with two tags. \\nListing 2.9\\nA container image can have multiple tags\\n \\n',\n",

Once you’re logged in, you can finally push the\\nyourid/kubia image to Docker Hub like this:\\n$ docker push luksa/kubia\\nRUNNING THE IMAGE ON A DIFFERENT MACHINE\\nAfter the push to Docker Hub is complete, the image will be available to everyone.\\nYou can now run the image on any machine running Docker by executing the follow-\\ning command:\\n$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d luksa/kubia\\nIt doesn’t get much simpler than that. And the best thing about this is that your appli-\\ncation will have the exact same environment every time and everywhere it’s run. If it\\nran fine on your machine, it should run as well on every other Linux machine. No\\nneed to worry about whether the host machine has Node.js installed or not. In fact,\\neven if it does, your app won’t use it, because it will use the one installed inside the\\nimage.\\n2.2\\nSetting up a Kubernetes cluster\\nNow that you have your app packaged inside a container image and made available\\nthrough Docker Hub, you can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster instead of running it\\nin Docker directly. But first, you need to set up the cluster itself. \\n Setting up a full-fledged, multi-node Kubernetes cluster isn’t a simple task, espe-\\ncially if you’re not well-versed in Linux and networking administration. A proper\\nKubernetes install spans multiple physical or virtual machines and requires the net-\\nworking to be set up properly, so that all the containers running inside the Kuberne-\\ntes cluster can connect to each other through the same flat networking space. \\n A long list of methods exists for installing a Kubernetes cluster. These methods are\\ndescribed in detail in the documentation at http:/\\n/kubernetes.io. We’re not going to\\nlist all of them here, because the list keeps evolving, but Kubernetes can be run on\\nyour local development machine, your own organization’s cluster of machines, on\\ncloud providers providing virtual machines (Google Compute Engine, Amazon EC2,\\nMicrosoft Azure, and so on), or by using a managed Kubernetes cluster such as Goo-\\ngle Kubernetes Engine (previously known as Google Container Engine). \\n In this chapter, we’ll cover two simple options for getting your hands on a running\\nKubernetes cluster. You’ll see how to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your\\nlocal machine and how to get access to a hosted cluster running on Google Kuberne-\\ntes Engine (GKE). \\n A third option, which covers installing a cluster with the kubeadm tool, is explained\\nin appendix B.

It\\nhelps you deploy production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters on AWS and\\nwill eventually support other platforms as well (Google Kubernetes Engine, VMware,\\nvSphere, and so on).\\n2.2.1\\nRunning a local single-node Kubernetes cluster with Minikube\\nThe simplest and quickest path to a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster is by using\\nMinikube. Minikube is a tool that sets up a single-node cluster that’s great for both\\ntesting Kubernetes and developing apps locally. \\n Although we can’t show certain Kubernetes features related to managing apps on\\nmultiple nodes, the single-node cluster should be enough for exploring most topics\\ndiscussed in this book. \\nINSTALLING MINIKUBE\\nMinikube is a single binary that needs to be downloaded and put onto your path. It’s\\navailable for OSX, Linux, and Windows. To install it, the best place to start is to go to\\nthe Minikube repository on GitHub (http:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/minikube) and\\nfollow the instructions there.\\n For example, on OSX and Linux, Minikube can be downloaded and set up with a\\nsingle command. For OSX, this is what the command looks like:\\n$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/\\n➥ v0.23.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube \\n➥ /usr/local/bin/\\nOn Linux, you download a different release (replace “darwin” with “linux” in the\\nURL). On Windows, you can download the file manually, rename it to minikube.exe,\\nand put it onto your path. Minikube runs Kubernetes inside a VM run through either\\nVirtualBox or KVM, so you also need to install one of them before you can start the\\nMinikube cluster.\\nSTARTING A KUBERNETES CLUSTER WITH MINIKUBE\\nOnce you have Minikube installed locally, you can immediately start up the Kuberne-\\ntes cluster with the command in the following listing.\\n$ minikube start\\nStarting local Kubernetes cluster...\\nStarting VM...\\nSSH-ing files into VM...\\n...\\nKubectl is now configured to use the cluster. \\nListing 2.10\\nStarting a Minikube virtual machine\\n \\n',\n",

Again, all you need\\nto do is download it and put it on your path. The latest stable release for OSX, for\\nexample, can be downloaded and installed with the following command:\\n$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\\n➥  /$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\\n➥  /stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl \\n➥  && chmod +x kubectl \\n➥  && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/\\nTo download kubectl for Linux or Windows, replace darwin in the URL with either\\nlinux or windows.\\nNOTE\\nIf you’ll be using multiple Kubernetes clusters (for example, both\\nMinikube and GKE), refer to appendix A for information on how to set up\\nand switch between different kubectl contexts.\\nCHECKING TO SEE THE CLUSTER IS UP AND KUBECTL CAN TALK TO IT\\nTo verify your cluster is working, you can use the kubectl cluster-info command\\nshown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl cluster-info\\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443\\nKubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/proxy/...\\nkubernetes-dashboard is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/...\\nThis shows the cluster is up.

For example, you may want to see what processes are run-\\nning on the node.\\n2.2.2\\nUsing a hosted Kubernetes cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine\\nIf you want to explore a full-fledged multi-node Kubernetes cluster instead, you can\\nuse a managed Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. This way, you don’t need to\\nmanually set up all the cluster nodes and networking, which is usually too much for\\nsomeone making their first steps with Kubernetes.

The output shows the node’s sta-\\ntus, its CPU and memory data, system information, containers running on the node,\\nand much more.\\n In the previous kubectl describe example, you specified the name of the node\\nexplicitly, but you could also have performed a simple kubectl describe node without\\ntyping the node’s name and it would print out a detailed description of all the nodes.\\nTIP\\nRunning the describe and get commands without specifying the name\\nof the object comes in handy when only one object of a given type exists, so\\nyou don’t waste time typing or copy/pasting the object’s name.\\nWhile we’re talking about reducing keystrokes, let me give you additional advice on\\nhow to make working with kubectl much easier, before we move on to running your\\nfirst app in Kubernetes.\\n2.2.3\\nSetting up an alias and command-line completion for kubectl \\nYou’ll use kubectl often. You’ll soon realize that having to type the full command\\nevery time is a real pain. Before you continue, take a minute to make your life easier\\nby setting up an alias and tab completion for kubectl.\\nCREATING AN ALIAS\\nThroughout the book, I’ll always be using the full name of the kubectl executable,\\nbut you may want to add a short alias such as k, so you won’t have to type kubectl\\nevery time. If you haven’t used aliases yet, here’s how you define one. Add the follow-\\ning line to your ~/.bashrc or equivalent file:\\nalias k=kubectl\\nNOTE\\nYou may already have the k executable if you used gcloud to set up the\\ncluster.\\nCONFIGURING TAB COMPLETION FOR KUBECTL\\nEven with a short alias such as k, you’ll still need to type way more than you’d like. Luck-\\nily, the kubectl command can also output shell completion code for both the bash and\\nzsh shell. It doesn’t enable tab completion of only command names, but also of the\\nactual object names. For example, instead of having to write the whole node name in\\nthe previous example, all you’d need to type is\\n$ kubectl desc<TAB> no<TAB> gke-ku<TAB>\\n \\n',\n",

When you run the preceding command, tab completion will\\nonly work when you use the full kubectl name (it won’t work when you use the k\\nalias). To fix this, you need to transform the output of the kubectl completion com-\\nmand a bit:\\n$ source <(kubectl completion bash | sed s/kubectl/k/g)\\nNOTE\\nUnfortunately, as I’m writing this, shell completion doesn’t work for\\naliases on MacOS. You’ll have to use the full kubectl command name if you\\nwant completion to work.\\nNow you’re all set to start interacting with your cluster without having to type too\\nmuch. You can finally run your first app on Kubernetes.\\n2.3\\nRunning your first app on Kubernetes\\nBecause this may be your first time, you’ll use the simplest possible way of running an\\napp on Kubernetes. Usually, you’d prepare a JSON or YAML manifest, containing a\\ndescription of all the components you want to deploy, but because we haven’t talked\\nabout the types of components you can create in Kubernetes yet, you’ll use a simple\\none-line command to get something running.\\n2.3.1\\nDeploying your Node.js app\\nThe simplest way to deploy your app is to use the kubectl run command, which will\\ncreate all the necessary components without having to deal with JSON or YAML. This\\nway, we don’t need to dive into the structure of each object yet. Try to run the image\\nyou created and pushed to Docker Hub earlier. Here’s how to run it in Kubernetes:\\n$ kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia --port=8080 --generator=run/v1\\nreplicationcontroller \"kubia\" created\\nThe --image=luksa/kubia part obviously specifies the container image you want to\\nrun, and the --port=8080 option tells Kubernetes that your app is listening on port\\n8080. The last flag (--generator) does require an explanation, though. Usually, you\\nwon’t use it, but you’re using it here so Kubernetes creates a ReplicationController\\ninstead of a Deployment. You’ll learn what ReplicationControllers are later in the chap-\\nter, but we won’t talk about Deployments until chapter 9. That’s why I don’t want\\nkubectl to create a Deployment yet.\\n As the previous command’s output shows, a ReplicationController called kubia\\nhas been created.

Maybe something such as kubectl get containers? Well, that’s not exactly\\nhow Kubernetes works. It doesn’t deal with individual containers directly. Instead, it\\nuses the concept of multiple co-located containers. This group of containers is called\\na Pod. \\n A pod is a group of one or more tightly related containers that will always run\\ntogether on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace(s). Each pod\\nis like a separate logical machine with its own IP, hostname, processes, and so on,\\nrunning a single application. The application can be a single process, running in a\\nsingle container, or it can be a main application process and additional supporting\\nprocesses, each running in its own container. All the containers in a pod will appear\\nto be running on the same logical machine, whereas containers in other pods, even\\nif they’re running on the same worker node, will appear to be running on a differ-\\nent one. \\n To better understand the relationship between containers, pods, and nodes, exam-\\nine figure 2.5. As you can see, each pod has its own IP and contains one or more con-\\ntainers, each running an application process. Pods are spread out across different\\nworker nodes.\\nLISTING PODS\\nBecause you can’t list individual containers, since they’re not standalone Kubernetes\\nobjects, can you list pods instead? Yes, you can. Let’s see how to tell kubectl to list\\npods in the following listing.\\nFigure 2.5\\nThe relationship between containers, pods, and physical worker nodes\\nWorker node 1\\nPod 2\\nIP: 10.1.0.2\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 3\\nIP: 10.1.0.3\\nContainer 1\\nPod 1\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nWorker node 2\\nPod 5\\nIP: 10.1.1.2\\nContainer 1\\nPod 6\\nIP: 10.1.1.3\\nContainer 1\\nPod 4\\nIP: 10.1.1.1\\nContainer\\nContainer 2\\nContainer 2\\n \\n',\n",

Its status is still Pending and the pod’s single container is shown as\\nnot ready yet (this is what the 0/1 in the READY column means).

If the pod stays stuck in\\nthe Pending status, it might be that Kubernetes can’t pull the image from the registry.\\nIf you’re using your own image, make sure it’s marked as public on Docker Hub. To\\nmake sure the image can be pulled successfully, try pulling the image manually with\\nthe docker pull command on another machine. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE SCENES\\nTo help you visualize what transpired, look at figure 2.6. It shows both steps you had to\\nperform to get a container image running inside Kubernetes. First, you built the\\nimage and pushed it to Docker Hub. This was necessary because building the image\\non your local machine only makes it available on your local machine, but you needed\\nto make it accessible to the Docker daemons running on your worker nodes.\\n When you ran the kubectl command, it created a new ReplicationController\\nobject in the cluster by sending a REST HTTP request to the Kubernetes API server.\\nThe ReplicationController then created a new pod, which was then scheduled to one\\nof the worker nodes by the Scheduler. The Kubelet on that node saw that the pod was\\nscheduled to it and instructed Docker to pull the specified image from the registry\\nbecause the image wasn’t available locally. After downloading the image, Docker cre-\\nated and ran the container. \\n The other two nodes are displayed to show context. They didn’t play any role in\\nthe process, because the pod wasn’t scheduled to them.\\nDEFINITION\\nThe term scheduling means assigning the pod to a node. The\\npod is run immediately, not at a time in the future as the term might lead you\\nto believe.\\nListing 2.14\\nListing pods\\nListing 2.15\\nListing pods again to see if the pod’s status has changed\\n \\n',\n",

Services are\\nobjects like Pods and Nodes, so you can see the newly created Service object by run-\\nning the kubectl get services command, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get services\\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)         AGE\\nkubernetes   10.3.240.1     <none>        443/TCP         34m\\nkubia-http   10.3.246.185   <pending>     8080:31348/TCP  4s\\nThe list shows two services.

As already mentioned, each pod behaves like a separate independent machine\\nwith its own IP address and hostname. Even though the application is running in\\nthe worker node’s operating system, to the app it appears as though it’s running on\\na separate machine dedicated to the app itself—no other processes are running\\nalongside it.\\n2.3.3\\nThe logical parts of your system\\nUntil now, I’ve mostly explained the actual physical components of your system. You\\nhave three worker nodes, which are VMs running Docker and the Kubelet, and you\\nhave a master node that controls the whole system. Honestly, we don’t know if a single\\nmaster node is hosting all the individual components of the Kubernetes Control Plane\\nor if they’re split across multiple nodes. It doesn’t really matter, because you’re only\\ninteracting with the API server, which is accessible at a single endpoint.\\n Besides this physical view of the system, there’s also a separate, logical view of it.\\nI’ve already mentioned Pods, ReplicationControllers, and Services. All of them will be\\nexplained in the next few chapters, but let’s quickly look at how they fit together and\\nwhat roles they play in your little setup.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER, THE POD, AND THE SERVICE FIT TOGETHER\\nAs I’ve already explained, you’re not creating and working with containers directly.\\nInstead, the basic building block in Kubernetes is the pod. But, you didn’t really cre-\\nate any pods either, at least not directly. By running the kubectl run command you\\ncreated a ReplicationController, and this ReplicationController is what created the\\nactual Pod object. To make that pod accessible from outside the cluster, you told\\nKubernetes to expose all the pods managed by that ReplicationController as a single\\nService. A rough picture of all three elements is presented in figure 2.7.\\nFigure 2.7\\nYour system consists of a ReplicationController, a Pod, and a Service.\\nPod: kubia-4jfyf\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nPort\\n8080\\nService: kubia-http\\nInternal IP: 10.3.246.185\\nExternal IP: 104.155.74.57\\nReplicationController: kubia\\nReplicas: 1\\nPort\\n8080\\nIncoming\\nrequest\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '48\\nCHAPTER 2\\nFirst steps with Docker and Kubernetes\\nUNDERSTANDING THE POD AND ITS CONTAINER\\nThe main and most important component in your system is the pod. It contains only a\\nsingle container, but generally a pod can contain as many containers as you want.\\nInside the container is your Node.js process, which is bound to port 8080 and is wait-\\ning for HTTP requests. The pod has its own unique private IP address and hostname. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nThe next component is the kubia ReplicationController. It makes sure there’s always\\nexactly one instance of your pod running. Generally, ReplicationControllers are used\\nto replicate pods (that is, create multiple copies of a pod) and keep them running. In\\nyour case, you didn’t specify how many pod replicas you want, so the Replication-\\nController created a single one. If your pod were to disappear for any reason, the\\nReplicationController would create a new pod to replace the missing one. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHY YOU NEED A SERVICE\\nThe third component of your system is the kubia-http service. To understand why\\nyou need services, you need to learn a key detail about pods. They’re ephemeral. A\\npod may disappear at any time—because the node it’s running on has failed, because\\nsomeone deleted the pod, or because the pod was evicted from an otherwise healthy\\nnode. When any of those occurs, a missing pod is replaced with a new one by the\\nReplicationController, as described previously. This new pod gets a different IP\\naddress from the pod it’s replacing. This is where services come in—to solve the prob-\\nlem of ever-changing pod IP addresses, as well as exposing multiple pods at a single\\nconstant IP and port pair. \\n When a service is created, it gets a static IP, which never changes during the lifetime of\\nthe service. Instead of connecting to pods directly, clients should connect to the service\\nthrough its constant IP address. The service makes sure one of the pods receives the con-\\nnection, regardless of where the pod is currently running (and what its IP address is). \\n Services represent a static location for a group of one or more pods that all provide\\nthe same service. Requests coming to the IP and port of the service will be forwarded\\nto the IP and port of one of the pods belonging to the service at that moment.  \\n2.3.4\\nHorizontally scaling the application\\nYou now have a running application, monitored and kept running by a Replication-\\nController and exposed to the world through a service. Now let’s make additional\\nmagic happen. \\n One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can\\nscale your deployments. Let’s see how easy it is to scale up the number of pods. You’ll\\nincrease the number of running instances to three. \\n Your pod is managed by a ReplicationController. Let’s see it with the kubectl get\\ncommand:\\n$ kubectl get replicationcontrollers\\nNAME        DESIRED    CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia       1          1         17m\\n \\nwww.allitebooks.com\\n',\n",

The DESIRED column\\nshows the number of pod replicas you want the ReplicationController to keep,\\nwhereas the CURRENT column shows the actual number of pods currently running. In\\nyour case, you wanted to have a single replica of the pod running, and exactly one\\nreplica is currently running. \\nINCREASING THE DESIRED REPLICA COUNT\\nTo scale up the number of replicas of your pod, you need to change the desired\\nreplica count on the ReplicationController like this:\\n$ kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=3\\nreplicationcontroller \"kubia\" scaled\\nYou’ve now told Kubernetes to make sure three instances of your pod are always run-\\nning. Notice that you didn’t instruct Kubernetes what action to take. You didn’t tell it\\nto add two more pods. You only set the new desired number of instances and let\\nKubernetes determine what actions it needs to take to achieve the requested state. \\n This is one of the most fundamental Kubernetes principles. Instead of telling\\nKubernetes exactly what actions it should perform, you’re only declaratively changing\\nthe desired state of the system and letting Kubernetes examine the current actual\\nstate and reconcile it with the desired state. This is true across all of Kubernetes.\\nSEEING THE RESULTS OF THE SCALE-OUT\\nBack to your replica count increase.

Two are already running, one is still\\npending, but should be ready in a few moments, as soon as the container image is\\ndownloaded and the container is started. \\n As you can see, scaling an application is incredibly simple. Once your app is run-\\nning in production and a need to scale the app arises, you can add additional\\ninstances with a single command without having to install and run additional copies\\nmanually. \\n Keep in mind that the app itself needs to support being scaled horizontally. Kuber-\\nnetes doesn’t magically make your app scalable; it only makes it trivial to scale the app\\nup or down. \\nSEEING REQUESTS HIT ALL THREE PODS WHEN HITTING THE SERVICE\\nBecause you now have multiple instances of your app running, let’s see what happens\\nif you hit the service URL again. Will you always hit the same app instance or not?\\n$ curl 104.155.74.57:8080\\nYou’ve hit kubia-hczji\\n$ curl 104.155.74.57:8080\\nYou’ve hit kubia-iq9y6\\n$ curl 104.155.74.57:8080\\nYou’ve hit kubia-iq9y6\\n$ curl 104.155.74.57:8080\\nYou’ve hit kubia-4jfyf   \\nRequests are hitting different pods randomly. This is what services in Kubernetes do\\nwhen more than one pod instance backs them. They act as a load balancer standing in\\nfront of multiple pods. When there’s only one pod, services provide a static address\\nfor the single pod. Whether a service is backed by a single pod or a group of pods,\\nthose pods come and go as they’re moved around the cluster, which means their IP\\naddresses change, but the service is always there at the same address. This makes it\\neasy for clients to connect to the pods, regardless of how many exist and how often\\nthey change location.\\nVISUALIZING THE NEW STATE OF YOUR SYSTEM\\nLet’s visualize your system again to see what’s changed from before. Figure 2.8\\nshows the new state of your system. You still have a single service and a single\\nReplicationController, but you now have three instances of your pod, all managed\\nby the ReplicationController. The service no longer sends all requests to a single\\npod, but spreads them across all three pods as shown in the experiment with curl\\nin the previous section.\\n As an exercise, you can now try spinning up additional instances by increasing the\\nReplicationController’s replica count even further and then scaling back down.\\n \\n',\n",

Instead of deploying containers individually,\\nyou always deploy and operate on a pod of containers. We’re not implying that a pod\\nalways includes more than one container—it’s common for pods to contain only a sin-\\ngle container. The key thing about pods is that when a pod does contain multiple con-\\ntainers, all of them are always run on a single worker node—it never spans multiple\\nworker nodes, as shown in figure 3.1.\\n3.1.1\\nUnderstanding why we need pods\\nBut why do we even need pods? Why can’t we use containers directly? Why would we\\neven need to run multiple containers together? Can’t we put all our processes into a\\nsingle container? We’ll answer those questions now.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHY MULTIPLE CONTAINERS ARE BETTER THAN ONE CONTAINER RUNNING \\nMULTIPLE PROCESSES\\nImagine an app consisting of multiple processes that either communicate through\\nIPC (Inter-Process Communication) or through locally stored files, which requires\\nthem to run on the same machine. Because in Kubernetes you always run processes in\\ncontainers and each container is much like an isolated machine, you may think it\\nmakes sense to run multiple processes in a single container, but you shouldn’t do that. \\n Containers are designed to run only a single process per container (unless the\\nprocess itself spawns child processes). If you run multiple unrelated processes in a\\nsingle container, it is your responsibility to keep all those processes running, man-\\nage their logs, and so on. For example, you’d have to include a mechanism for auto-\\nmatically restarting individual processes if they crash. Also, all those processes would\\nlog to the same standard output, so you’d have a hard time figuring out what pro-\\ncess logged what. \\nNode 1\\nPod 2\\nIP: 10.1.0.2\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 1\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nNode 2\\nPod 4\\nIP: 10.1.1.2\\nContainer 1\\nPod 5\\nIP: 10.1.1.3\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 3\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nFigure 3.1\\nAll containers of a pod run on the same node.

That’s how Docker\\nand Kubernetes are meant to be used. \\n3.1.2\\nUnderstanding pods\\nBecause you’re not supposed to group multiple processes into a single container, it’s\\nobvious you need another higher-level construct that will allow you to bind containers\\ntogether and manage them as a single unit. This is the reasoning behind pods. \\n A pod of containers allows you to run closely related processes together and pro-\\nvide them with (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single\\ncontainer, while keeping them somewhat isolated. This way, you get the best of both\\nworlds. You can take advantage of all the features containers provide, while at the\\nsame time giving the processes the illusion of running together. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE PARTIAL ISOLATION BETWEEN CONTAINERS OF THE SAME POD\\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that containers are completely isolated from\\neach other, but now you see that you want to isolate groups of containers instead of\\nindividual ones. You want containers inside each group to share certain resources,\\nalthough not all, so that they’re not fully isolated. Kubernetes achieves this by config-\\nuring Docker to have all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces\\ninstead of each container having its own set. \\n Because all containers of a pod run under the same Network and UTS namespaces\\n(we’re talking about Linux namespaces here), they all share the same hostname and\\nnetwork interfaces. Similarly, all containers of a pod run under the same IPC namespace\\nand can communicate through IPC. In the latest Kubernetes and Docker versions, they\\ncan also share the same PID namespace, but that feature isn’t enabled by default. \\nNOTE\\nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, you\\nonly see the container’s own processes when running ps aux in the container.\\nBut when it comes to the filesystem, things are a little different. Because most of the\\ncontainer’s filesystem comes from the container image, by default, the filesystem of\\neach container is fully isolated from other containers. However, it’s possible to have\\nthem share file directories using a Kubernetes concept called a Volume, which we’ll\\ntalk about in chapter 6.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS SHARE THE SAME IP AND PORT SPACE\\nOne thing to stress here is that because containers in a pod run in the same Network\\nnamespace, they share the same IP address and port space. This means processes run-\\nning in containers of the same pod need to take care not to bind to the same port\\nnumbers or they’ll run into port conflicts. But this only concerns containers in the\\nsame pod. Containers of different pods can never run into port conflicts, because\\neach pod has a separate port space. All the containers in a pod also have the same\\nloopback network interface, so a container can communicate with other containers in\\nthe same pod through localhost.\\n \\n',\n",

No NAT (Network Address Translation) gateways exist between them.\\nWhen two pods send network packets between each other, they’ll each see the actual\\nIP address of the other as the source IP in the packet.\\nConsequently, communication between pods is always simple. It doesn’t matter if two\\npods are scheduled onto a single or onto different worker nodes; in both cases the\\ncontainers inside those pods can communicate with each other across the flat NAT-\\nless network, much like computers on a local area network (LAN), regardless of the\\nactual inter-node network topology. Like a computer on a LAN, each pod gets its own\\nIP address and is accessible from all other pods through this network established spe-\\ncifically for pods. This is usually achieved through an additional software-defined net-\\nwork layered on top of the actual network.\\n To sum up what’s been covered in this section: pods are logical hosts and behave\\nmuch like physical hosts or VMs in the non-container world. Processes running in the\\nsame pod are like processes running on the same physical or virtual machine, except\\nthat each process is encapsulated in a container. \\n3.1.3\\nOrganizing containers across pods properly\\nYou should think of pods as separate machines, but where each one hosts only a cer-\\ntain app. Unlike the old days, when we used to cram all sorts of apps onto the same\\nhost, we don’t do that with pods. Because pods are relatively lightweight, you can have\\nas many as you need without incurring almost any overhead. Instead of stuffing every-\\nthing into a single pod, you should organize apps into multiple pods, where each one\\ncontains only tightly related components or processes.\\nNode 1\\nPod A\\nIP: 10.1.1.6\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod B\\nIP: 10.1.1.7\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nNode 2\\nFlat network\\nPod C\\nIP: 10.1.2.5\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod D\\nIP: 10.1.2.7\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nFigure 3.2\\nEach pod gets a routable IP address and all other pods see the pod under \\nthat IP address.\\n \\n',\n",

We’ve\\nsaid that all containers of the same pod always run co-located, but do the web server\\nand the database really need to run on the same machine? The answer is obviously no,\\nso you don’t want to put them into a single pod. But is it wrong to do so regardless? In\\na way, it is.\\n If both the frontend and backend are in the same pod, then both will always be\\nrun on the same machine. If you have a two-node Kubernetes cluster and only this sin-\\ngle pod, you’ll only be using a single worker node and not taking advantage of the\\ncomputational resources (CPU and memory) you have at your disposal on the second\\nnode. Splitting the pod into two would allow Kubernetes to schedule the frontend to\\none node and the backend to the other node, thereby improving the utilization of\\nyour infrastructure.\\nSPLITTING INTO MULTIPLE PODS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUAL SCALING\\nAnother reason why you shouldn’t put them both into a single pod is scaling. A pod is\\nalso the basic unit of scaling. Kubernetes can’t horizontally scale individual contain-\\ners; instead, it scales whole pods. If your pod consists of a frontend and a backend con-\\ntainer, when you scale up the number of instances of the pod to, let’s say, two, you end\\nup with two frontend containers and two backend containers. \\n Usually, frontend components have completely different scaling requirements\\nthan the backends, so we tend to scale them individually. Not to mention the fact that\\nbackends such as databases are usually much harder to scale compared to (stateless)\\nfrontend web servers. If you need to scale a container individually, this is a clear indi-\\ncation that it needs to be deployed in a separate pod. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHEN TO USE MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD\\nThe main reason to put multiple containers into a single pod is when the application\\nconsists of one main process and one or more complementary processes, as shown in\\nfigure 3.3.\\nPod\\nMain container\\nSupporting\\ncontainer 1\\nSupporting\\ncontainer 2\\nVolume\\nFigure 3.3\\nPods should contain tightly coupled \\ncontainers, usually a main container and containers \\nthat support the main one.\\n \\n',\n",

In chapter 6 you’ll see that you need to use a Kubernetes Volume that you\\nmount into both containers. \\n Other examples of sidecar containers include log rotators and collectors, data pro-\\ncessors, communication adapters, and others.\\nDECIDING WHEN TO USE MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD\\nTo recap how containers should be grouped into pods—when deciding whether to\\nput two containers into a single pod or into two separate pods, you always need to ask\\nyourself the following questions:\\n\\uf0a1Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?\\n\\uf0a1Do they represent a single whole or are they independent components?\\n\\uf0a1Must they be scaled together or individually? \\nBasically, you should always gravitate toward running containers in separate pods,\\nunless a specific reason requires them to be part of the same pod. Figure 3.4 will help\\nyou memorize this.\\nAlthough pods can contain multiple containers, to keep things simple for now, you’ll\\nonly be dealing with single-container pods in this chapter.

First, there’s the Kubernetes API version\\nused in the YAML and the type of resource the YAML is describing. Then, three\\nimportant sections are found in almost all Kubernetes resources:\\n\\uf0a1Metadata includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about\\nthe pod.\\n\\uf0a1Spec contains the actual description of the pod’s contents, such as the pod’s con-\\ntainers, volumes, and other data.\\nPod specification/\\ncontents (list of \\npod’s containers, \\nvolumes, and so on)\\nDetailed status \\nof the pod and \\nits containers\\n \\n',\n",

The status\\npart contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given\\nmoment. When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part. \\n The three parts described previously show the typical structure of a Kubernetes\\nAPI object. As you’ll see throughout the book, all other objects have the same anat-\\nomy. This makes understanding new objects relatively easy.\\n Going through all the individual properties in the previous YAML doesn’t make\\nmuch sense, so, instead, let’s see what the most basic YAML for creating a pod looks\\nlike. \\n3.2.2\\nCreating a simple YAML descriptor for a pod\\nYou’re going to create a file called kubia-manual.yaml (you can create it in any\\ndirectory you want), or download the book’s code archive, where you’ll find the\\nfile inside the Chapter03 directory. The following listing shows the entire contents\\nof the file.\\napiVersion: v1         \\nkind: Pod                             \\nmetadata:     \\n  name: kubia-manual         \\nspec: \\n  containers: \\n  - image: luksa/kubia          \\n    name: kubia         \\n    ports: \\n    - containerPort: 8080     \\n      protocol: TCP\\nI’m sure you’ll agree this is much simpler than the definition in listing 3.1. Let’s exam-\\nine this descriptor in detail. It conforms to the v1 version of the Kubernetes API. The\\ntype of resource you’re describing is a pod, with the name kubia-manual. The pod\\nconsists of a single container based on the luksa/kubia image. You’ve also given a\\nname to the container and indicated that it’s listening on port 8080. \\nSPECIFYING CONTAINER PORTS\\nSpecifying ports in the pod definition is purely informational. Omitting them has no\\neffect on whether clients can connect to the pod through the port or not.

Explicitly defining ports also allows you to\\nassign a name to each port, which can come in handy, as you’ll see later in the book.\\nUsing kubectl explain to discover possible API object fields\\nWhen preparing a manifest, you can either turn to the Kubernetes reference\\ndocumentation at http:/\\n/kubernetes.io/docs/api to see which attributes are\\nsupported by each API object, or you can use the kubectl explain command.\\nFor example, when creating a pod manifest from scratch, you can start by asking\\nkubectl to explain pods:\\n$ kubectl explain pods\\nDESCRIPTION:\\nPod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource \\nis created by clients and scheduled onto hosts.\\nFIELDS:\\n   kind      <string>\\n     Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object\\n     represents...\\n   metadata  <Object>\\n     Standard object's metadata...\\n   spec      <Object>\\n     Specification of the desired behavior of the pod...\\n   status    <Object>\\n     Most recently observed status of the pod.

As you can see, retrieving logs of an appli-\\ncation running in Kubernetes is incredibly simple if the pod only contains a single\\ncontainer. \\nNOTE\\nContainer logs are automatically rotated daily and every time the log file\\nreaches 10MB in size. The kubectl logs command only shows the log entries\\nfrom the last rotation.\\nSPECIFYING THE CONTAINER NAME WHEN GETTING LOGS OF A MULTI-CONTAINER POD\\nIf your pod includes multiple containers, you have to explicitly specify the container\\nname by including the -c <container name> option when running kubectl logs. In\\nyour kubia-manual pod, you set the container’s name to kubia, so if additional con-\\ntainers exist in the pod, you’d have to get its logs like this:\\n$ kubectl logs kubia-manual -c kubia\\nKubia server starting...\\nNote that you can only retrieve container logs of pods that are still in existence. When\\na pod is deleted, its logs are also deleted. To make a pod’s logs available even after the\\npod is deleted, you need to set up centralized, cluster-wide logging, which stores all\\nthe logs into a central store. Chapter 17 explains how centralized logging works.\\n3.2.5\\nSending requests to the pod\\nThe pod is now running—at least that’s what kubectl get and your app’s log say. But\\nhow do you see it in action? In the previous chapter, you used the kubectl expose\\ncommand to create a service to gain access to the pod externally.

As I’ve mentioned in the previous chapter, this is the proper way\\nof working in a Kubernetes cluster. Because Kubernetes exposes all the nodes in the\\ncluster as a single, large deployment platform, it shouldn’t matter to you what node a\\npod is scheduled to. Because each pod gets the exact amount of computational\\nresources it requests (CPU, memory, and so on) and its accessibility from other pods\\nisn’t at all affected by the node the pod is scheduled to, usually there shouldn’t be any\\nneed for you to tell Kubernetes exactly where to schedule your pods. \\n Certain cases exist, however, where you’ll want to have at least a little say in where\\na pod should be scheduled. A good example is when your hardware infrastructure\\nisn’t homogenous. If part of your worker nodes have spinning hard drives, whereas\\nothers have SSDs, you may want to schedule certain pods to one group of nodes and\\nthe rest to the other. Another example is when you need to schedule pods perform-\\ning intensive GPU-based computation only to nodes that provide the required GPU\\nacceleration. \\n You never want to say specifically what node a pod should be scheduled to, because\\nthat would couple the application to the infrastructure, whereas the whole idea of\\nKubernetes is hiding the actual infrastructure from the apps that run on it. But if you\\nwant to have a say in where a pod should be scheduled, instead of specifying an exact\\nnode, you should describe the node requirements and then let Kubernetes select a\\nnode that matches those requirements. This can be done through node labels and\\nnode label selectors. \\nUI pod\\napp: ui\\nrel: stable\\nrel=stable\\napp=ui\\nAccount\\nService\\npod\\napp: as\\nrel: stable\\napp=as\\napp: pc\\nrel: stable\\napp=pc\\napp: sc\\nrel: stable\\napp=sc\\napp: os\\nrel: stable\\napp=os\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nShopping\\nCart\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nUI pod\\napp: ui\\nrel: beta\\nrel=beta\\napp: pc\\nrel: beta\\napp: os\\nrel: beta\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nrel=canary\\nAccount\\nService\\npod\\napp: as\\nrel: canary\\napp: pc\\nrel: canary\\napp: os\\nrel: canary\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nFigure 3.9\\nSelecting pods with multiple label selectors\\n \\n',\n",

Labels can be attached to any Kubernetes object, including nodes.\\nUsually, when the ops team adds a new node to the cluster, they’ll categorize the node\\nby attaching labels specifying the type of hardware the node provides or anything else\\nthat may come in handy when scheduling pods. \\n Let’s imagine one of the nodes in your cluster contains a GPU meant to be used\\nfor general-purpose GPU computing. You want to add a label to the node showing this\\nfeature. You’re going to add the label gpu=true to one of your nodes (pick one out of\\nthe list returned by kubectl get nodes):\\n$ kubectl label node gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx gpu=true\\nnode \"gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx\" labeled\\nNow you can use a label selector when listing the nodes, like you did before with pods.\\nList only nodes that include the label gpu=true:\\n$ kubectl get nodes -l gpu=true\\nNAME                      STATUS AGE\\ngke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx  Ready  1d\\nAs expected, only one node has this label. You can also try listing all the nodes and tell\\nkubectl to display an additional column showing the values of each node’s gpu label\\n(kubectl get nodes -L gpu).\\n3.5.2\\nScheduling pods to specific nodes\\nNow imagine you want to deploy a new pod that needs a GPU to perform its work.\\nTo ask the scheduler to only choose among the nodes that provide a GPU, you’ll\\nadd a node selector to the pod’s YAML. Create a file called kubia-gpu.yaml with the\\nfollowing listing’s contents and then use kubectl create -f kubia-gpu.yaml to cre-\\nate the pod.\\napiVersion: v1                                         \\nkind: Pod                                              \\nmetadata:                                              \\n  name: kubia-gpu\\nspec: \\n  nodeSelector:               \\n    gpu: \"true\"               \\n  containers: \\n  - image: luksa/kubia\\n    name: kubia\\nListing 3.4\\nUsing a label selector to schedule a pod to a specific node: kubia-gpu.yaml\\nnodeSelector tells Kubernetes \\nto deploy this pod only to \\nnodes containing the \\ngpu=true label.\\n \\n',\n",

When you create the pod,\\nthe scheduler will only choose among the nodes that contain the gpu=true label\\n(which is only a single node in your case). \\n3.5.3\\nScheduling to one specific node\\nSimilarly, you could also schedule a pod to an exact node, because each node also has\\na unique label with the key kubernetes.io/hostname and value set to the actual host-\\nname of the node. But setting the nodeSelector to a specific node by the hostname\\nlabel may lead to the pod being unschedulable if the node is offline. You shouldn’t\\nthink in terms of individual nodes. Always think about logical groups of nodes that sat-\\nisfy certain criteria specified through label selectors.\\n This was a quick demonstration of how labels and label selectors work and how\\nthey can be used to influence the operation of Kubernetes. The importance and use-\\nfulness of label selectors will become even more evident when we talk about Replication-\\nControllers and Services in the next two chapters. \\nNOTE\\nAdditional ways of influencing which node a pod is scheduled to are\\ncovered in chapter 16.\\n3.6\\nAnnotating pods\\nIn addition to labels, pods and other objects can also contain annotations. Annotations\\nare also key-value pairs, so in essence, they’re similar to labels, but they aren’t meant to\\nhold identifying information. They can’t be used to group objects the way labels can.\\nWhile objects can be selected through label selectors, there’s no such thing as an\\nannotation selector. \\n On the other hand, annotations can hold much larger pieces of information and\\nare primarily meant to be used by tools. Certain annotations are automatically added\\nto objects by Kubernetes, but others are added by users manually.\\n Annotations are also commonly used when introducing new features to Kuberne-\\ntes. Usually, alpha and beta versions of new features don’t introduce any new fields to\\nAPI objects. Annotations are used instead of fields, and then once the required API\\nchanges have become clear and been agreed upon by the Kubernetes developers, new\\nfields are introduced and the related annotations deprecated.\\n A great use of annotations is adding descriptions for each pod or other API object,\\nso that everyone using the cluster can quickly look up information about each individ-\\nual object. For example, an annotation used to specify the name of the person who\\ncreated the object can make collaboration between everyone working on the cluster\\nmuch easier.\\n3.6.1\\nLooking up an object’s annotations\\nLet’s see an example of an annotation that Kubernetes added automatically to the\\npod you created in the previous chapter.

The simplest way to add\\nan annotation to an existing object is through the kubectl annotate command. \\n You’ll try adding an annotation to your kubia-manual pod now:\\n$ kubectl annotate pod kubia-manual mycompany.com/someannotation=\"foo bar\"\\npod \"kubia-manual\" annotated\\nYou added the annotation mycompany.com/someannotation with the value foo bar.\\nIt’s a good idea to use this format for annotation keys to prevent key collisions.

We’ve seen how they organize pods and other\\nobjects into groups. Because each object can have multiple labels, those groups of\\nobjects can overlap.

You may want to only operate inside one group at a time. For this and other\\nreasons, Kubernetes also groups objects into namespaces. These aren’t the Linux\\nnamespaces we talked about in chapter 2, which are used to isolate processes from\\neach other. Kubernetes namespaces provide a scope for objects names. Instead of hav-\\ning all your resources in one single namespace, you can split them into multiple name-\\nspaces, which also allows you to use the same resource names multiple times (across\\ndifferent namespaces).\\n3.7.1\\nUnderstanding the need for namespaces\\nUsing multiple namespaces allows you to split complex systems with numerous com-\\nponents into smaller distinct groups. They can also be used for separating resources\\nin a multi-tenant environment, splitting up resources into production, development,\\nand QA environments, or in any other way you may need. Resource names only need\\nto be unique within a namespace. Two different namespaces can contain resources of\\nthe same name. But, while most types of resources are namespaced, a few aren’t. One\\nof them is the Node resource, which is global and not tied to a single namespace.\\nYou’ll learn about other cluster-level resources in later chapters.\\n Let’s see how to use namespaces now.\\n3.7.2\\nDiscovering other namespaces and their pods\\nFirst, let’s list all namespaces in your cluster:\\n$ kubectl get ns\\nNAME          LABELS    STATUS    AGE\\ndefault       <none>    Active    1h\\nkube-public   <none>    Active    1h\\nkube-system   <none>    Active    1h\\nUp to this point, you’ve operated only in the default namespace. When listing resources\\nwith the kubectl get command, you’ve never specified the namespace explicitly, so\\nkubectl always defaulted to the default namespace, showing you only the objects in\\nthat namespace. But as you can see from the list, the kube-public and the kube-system\\nnamespaces also exist. Let’s look at the pods that belong to the kube-system name-\\nspace, by telling kubectl to list pods in that namespace only:\\n$ kubectl get po --namespace kube-system\\nNAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nfluentd-cloud-kubia-e8fe-node-txje   1/1       Running   0          1h\\nheapster-v11-fz1ge                   1/1       Running   0          1h\\nkube-dns-v9-p8a4t                    0/4       Pending   0          1h\\nkube-ui-v4-kdlai                     1/1       Running   0          1h\\nl7-lb-controller-v0.5.2-bue96        2/2       Running   92         1h\\nTIP\\nYou can also use -n instead of --namespace.\\n \\n',\n",

If they were\\nall in the default namespace, mixed in with the resources you create yourself, you’d\\nhave a hard time seeing what belongs where, and you might inadvertently delete sys-\\ntem resources. \\n Namespaces enable you to separate resources that don’t belong together into non-\\noverlapping groups. If several users or groups of users are using the same Kubernetes\\ncluster, and they each manage their own distinct set of resources, they should each use\\ntheir own namespace.

But if the whole node\\nfails, the pods on the node are lost and will not be replaced with new ones, unless\\nthose pods are managed by the previously mentioned ReplicationControllers or simi-\\nlar. In this chapter, you’ll learn how Kubernetes checks if a container is still alive and\\nrestarts it if it isn’t. You’ll also learn how to run managed pods—both those that run\\nindefinitely and those that perform a single task and then stop. \\n4.1\\nKeeping pods healthy\\nOne of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the ability to give it a list of contain-\\ners and let it keep those containers running somewhere in the cluster. You do this by\\ncreating a Pod resource and letting Kubernetes pick a worker node for it and run\\nthe pod’s containers on that node. But what if one of those containers dies? What if\\nall containers of a pod die? \\n As soon as a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node will run its con-\\ntainers and, from then on, keep them running as long as the pod exists. If the con-\\ntainer’s main process crashes, the Kubelet will restart the container. If your\\napplication has a bug that causes it to crash every once in a while, Kubernetes will\\nrestart it automatically, so even without doing anything special in the app itself, run-\\nning the app in Kubernetes automatically gives it the ability to heal itself. \\n But sometimes apps stop working without their process crashing. For example, a\\nJava app with a memory leak will start throwing OutOfMemoryErrors, but the JVM\\nprocess will keep running. It would be great to have a way for an app to signal to\\nKubernetes that it’s no longer functioning properly and have Kubernetes restart it. \\n We’ve said that a container that crashes is restarted automatically, so maybe you’re\\nthinking you could catch these types of errors in the app and exit the process when\\nthey occur. You can certainly do that, but it still doesn’t solve all your problems. \\n For example, what about those situations when your app stops responding because\\nit falls into an infinite loop or a deadlock? To make sure applications are restarted in\\nsuch cases, you must check an application’s health from the outside and not depend\\non the app doing it internally. \\n4.1.1\\nIntroducing liveness probes\\nKubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes. You can specify\\na liveness probe for each container in the pod’s specification. Kubernetes will periodi-\\ncally execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails. \\nNOTE\\nKubernetes also supports readiness probes, which we’ll learn about in the\\nnext chapter. Be sure not to confuse the two. They’re used for two different\\nthings.\\nKubernetes can probe a container using one of the three mechanisms:\\n\\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe performs an HTTP GET request on the container’s IP\\naddress, a port and path you specify.

If the server returns an\\nerror response code or if it doesn’t respond at all, the probe is considered a fail-\\nure and the container will be restarted as a result.\\n\\uf0a1A TCP Socket probe tries to open a TCP connection to the specified port of the\\ncontainer. If the connection is established successfully, the probe is successful.\\nOtherwise, the container is restarted.\\n\\uf0a1An Exec probe executes an arbitrary command inside the container and checks\\nthe command’s exit status code. If the status code is 0, the probe is successful.\\nAll other codes are considered failures. \\n4.1.2\\nCreating an HTTP-based liveness probe\\nLet’s see how to add a liveness probe to your Node.js app. Because it’s a web app, it\\nmakes sense to add a liveness probe that will check whether its web server is serving\\nrequests. But because this particular Node.js app is too simple to ever fail, you’ll need\\nto make the app fail artificially. \\n To properly demo liveness probes, you’ll modify the app slightly and make it\\nreturn a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status code for each request after the fifth\\none—your app will handle the first five client requests properly and then return an\\nerror on every subsequent request. Thanks to the liveness probe, it should be restarted\\nwhen that happens, allowing it to properly handle client requests again.\\n You can find the code of the new app in the book’s code archive (in the folder\\nChapter04/kubia-unhealthy). I’ve pushed the container image to Docker Hub, so you\\ndon’t need to build it yourself. \\n You’ll create a new pod that includes an HTTP GET liveness probe. The following\\nlisting shows the YAML for the pod.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia-liveness\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: luksa/kubia-unhealthy   \\n    name: kubia\\n    livenessProbe:                 \\n      httpGet:                     \\n        path: /                     \\n        port: 8080       \\nListing 4.1\\nAdding a liveness probe to a pod: kubia-liveness-probe.yaml\\nThis is the image \\ncontaining the \\n(somewhat) \\nbroken app.\\nA liveness probe that will \\nperform an HTTP GET\\nThe path to \\nrequest in the \\nHTTP request\\nThe network port\\nthe probe should\\nconnect to\\n \\n',\n",

The exit code was 137, which has a special meaning—it denotes\\nthat the process was terminated by an external signal. The number 137 is a sum of two\\nnumbers: 128+x, where x is the signal number sent to the process that caused it to ter-\\nminate. In the example, x equals 9, which is the number of the SIGKILL signal, mean-\\ning the process was killed forcibly.\\n The events listed at the bottom show why the container was killed—Kubernetes\\ndetected the container was unhealthy, so it killed and re-created it. \\nNOTE\\nWhen a container is killed, a completely new container is created—it’s\\nnot the same container being restarted again.\\n4.1.4\\nConfiguring additional properties of the liveness probe\\nYou may have noticed that kubectl describe also displays additional information\\nabout the liveness probe:\\nLiveness: http-get http://:8080/ delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1 \\n          ➥ #failure=3\\nBeside the liveness probe options you specified explicitly, you can also see additional\\nproperties, such as delay, timeout, period, and so on. The delay=0s part shows that\\nthe probing begins immediately after the container is started. The timeout is set to\\nonly 1 second, so the container must return a response in 1 second or the probe is\\ncounted as failed. The container is probed every 10 seconds (period=10s) and the\\ncontainer is restarted after the probe fails three consecutive times (#failure=3). \\n These additional parameters can be customized when defining the probe.

But if they’d used kubectl describe, they’d have seen that the con-\\ntainer terminated with exit code 137 or 143, telling them that the pod was terminated\\nexternally. Additionally, the listing of the pod’s events would show that the container\\nwas killed because of a failed liveness probe.

Likewise, exit code 143 corresponds to 128 +\\n15 (SIGTERM).\\n4.1.5\\nCreating effective liveness probes\\nFor pods running in production, you should always define a liveness probe. Without\\none, Kubernetes has no way of knowing whether your app is still alive or not. As long\\nas the process is still running, Kubernetes will consider the container to be healthy. \\nWHAT A LIVENESS PROBE SHOULD CHECK\\nYour simplistic liveness probe simply checks if the server is responding. While this may\\nseem overly simple, even a liveness probe like this does wonders, because it causes the\\ncontainer to be restarted if the web server running within the container stops\\nresponding to HTTP requests. Compared to having no liveness probe, this is a major\\nimprovement, and may be sufficient in most cases.\\n But for a better liveness check, you’d configure the probe to perform requests on a\\nspecific URL path (/health, for example) and have the app perform an internal sta-\\ntus check of all the vital components running inside the app to ensure none of them\\nhas died or is unresponsive. \\nTIP\\nMake sure the /health HTTP endpoint doesn’t require authentication;\\notherwise the probe will always fail, causing your container to be restarted\\nindefinitely.\\nBe sure to check only the internals of the app and nothing influenced by an external\\nfactor. For example, a frontend web server’s liveness probe shouldn’t return a failure\\nwhen the server can’t connect to the backend database. If the underlying cause is in\\nthe database itself, restarting the web server container will not fix the problem.\\nKubernetes will wait 15 seconds \\nbefore executing the first probe.\\n \\n',\n",

By default, the probes are executed relatively often and are\\nonly allowed one second to complete. Having a probe that does heavy lifting can slow\\ndown your container considerably. Later in the book, you’ll also learn about how to\\nlimit CPU time available to a container. The probe’s CPU time is counted in the con-\\ntainer’s CPU time quota, so having a heavyweight liveness probe will reduce the CPU\\ntime available to the main application processes.\\nTIP\\nIf you’re running a Java app in your container, be sure to use an HTTP\\nGET liveness probe instead of an Exec probe, where you spin up a whole new\\nJVM to get the liveness information. The same goes for any JVM-based or sim-\\nilar applications, whose start-up procedure requires considerable computa-\\ntional resources.\\nDON’T BOTHER IMPLEMENTING RETRY LOOPS IN YOUR PROBES\\nYou’ve already seen that the failure threshold for the probe is configurable and usu-\\nally the probe must fail multiple times before the container is killed. But even if you\\nset the failure threshold to 1, Kubernetes will retry the probe several times before con-\\nsidering it a single failed attempt. Therefore, implementing your own retry loop into\\nthe probe is wasted effort.\\nLIVENESS PROBE WRAP-UP\\nYou now understand that Kubernetes keeps your containers running by restarting\\nthem if they crash or if their liveness probes fail. This job is performed by the Kubelet\\non the node hosting the pod—the Kubernetes Control Plane components running on\\nthe master(s) have no part in this process. \\n But if the node itself crashes, it’s the Control Plane that must create replacements for\\nall the pods that went down with the node. It doesn’t do that for pods that you create\\ndirectly. Those pods aren’t managed by anything except by the Kubelet, but because the\\nKubelet runs on the node itself, it can’t do anything if the node fails. \\n To make sure your app is restarted on another node, you need to have the pod\\nmanaged by a ReplicationController or similar mechanism, which we’ll discuss in the\\nrest of this chapter. \\n4.2\\nIntroducing ReplicationControllers\\nA ReplicationController is a Kubernetes resource that ensures its pods are always\\nkept running. If the pod disappears for any reason, such as in the event of a node\\ndisappearing from the cluster or because the pod was evicted from the node, the\\nReplicationController notices the missing pod and creates a replacement pod. \\n Figure 4.1 shows what happens when a node goes down and takes two pods with it.\\nPod A was created directly and is therefore an unmanaged pod, while pod B is managed\\n \\n',\n",

ReplicationCon-\\ntrollers also don’t care about the actual “contents” of its pods (the container images,\\nenvironment variables, and other things) after they create the pod. The template\\ntherefore only affects new pods created by this ReplicationController. You can think\\nof it as a cookie cutter for cutting out new pods.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS OF USING A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nLike many things in Kubernetes, a ReplicationController, although an incredibly sim-\\nple concept, provides or enables the following powerful features:\\n\\uf0a1It makes sure a pod (or multiple pod replicas) is always running by starting a\\nnew pod when an existing one goes missing.\\n\\uf0a1When a cluster node fails, it creates replacement replicas for all the pods that\\nwere running on the failed node (those that were under the Replication-\\nController’s control).\\n\\uf0a1It enables easy horizontal scaling of pods—both manual and automatic (see\\nhorizontal pod auto-scaling in chapter 15).\\nNOTE\\nA pod instance is never relocated to another node. Instead, the\\nReplicationController creates a completely new pod instance that has no rela-\\ntion to the instance it’s replacing. \\n4.2.2\\nCreating a ReplicationController\\nLet’s look at how to create a ReplicationController and then see how it keeps your\\npods running. Like pods and other Kubernetes resources, you create a Replication-\\nController by posting a JSON or YAML descriptor to the Kubernetes API server.\\n You’re going to create a YAML file called kubia-rc.yaml for your Replication-\\nController, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ReplicationController     \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia                      \\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3                     \\n  selector:              \\n    app: kubia           \\nListing 4.4\\nA YAML definition of a ReplicationController: kubia-rc.yaml\\nThis manifest defines a \\nReplicationController (RC)\\nThe name of this \\nReplicationController\\nThe desired number \\nof pod instances\\nThe pod selector determining \\nwhat pods the RC is operating on\\n \\n',\n",

The contents of the template are almost identical to\\nthe pod definition you created in the previous chapter. \\n The pod labels in the template must obviously match the label selector of the\\nReplicationController; otherwise the controller would create new pods indefinitely,\\nbecause spinning up a new pod wouldn’t bring the actual replica count any closer to\\nthe desired number of replicas.

If you’re using Google Kubernetes Engine\\nto run these examples, you have a three-node Kubernetes cluster. You’re going to dis-\\nconnect one of the nodes from the network to simulate a node failure.\\nNOTE\\nIf you’re using Minikube, you can’t do this exercise, because you only\\nhave one node that acts both as a master and a worker node.\\nIf a node fails in the non-Kubernetes world, the ops team would need to migrate the\\napplications running on that node to other machines manually. Kubernetes, on the\\nother hand, does that automatically. Soon after the ReplicationController detects that\\nits pods are down, it will spin up new pods to replace them. \\n Let’s see this in action. You need to ssh into one of the nodes with the gcloud\\ncompute ssh command and then shut down its network interface with sudo ifconfig\\neth0 down, as shown in the following listing.\\nNOTE\\nChoose a node that runs at least one of your pods by listing pods with\\nthe -o wide option.\\n$ gcloud compute ssh gke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko\\nEnter passphrase for key '/home/luksa/.ssh/google_compute_engine':\\nWelcome to Kubernetes v1.6.4!\\n...\\nluksa@gke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko ~ $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down\\nWhen you shut down the network interface, the ssh session will stop responding, so\\nyou need to open up another terminal or hard-exit from the ssh session. In the new\\nterminal you can list the nodes to see if Kubernetes has detected that the node is\\ndown. This takes a minute or so. Then, the node’s status is shown as NotReady:\\n$ kubectl get node\\nNAME                                   STATUS     AGE\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-opc5   Ready      5h\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-s8gj   Ready      5h\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko   NotReady   5h    \\nIf you list the pods now, you’ll still see the same three pods as before, because Kuber-\\nnetes waits a while before rescheduling pods (in case the node is unreachable because\\nof a temporary network glitch or because the Kubelet is restarting). If the node stays\\nunreachable for several minutes, the status of the pods that were scheduled to that\\nnode changes to Unknown. At that point, the ReplicationController will immediately\\nspin up a new pod. You can see this by listing the pods again:\\nListing 4.6\\nSimulating a node failure by shutting down its network interface\\nNode isn’t ready, \\nbecause it’s \\ndisconnected from \\nthe network\\n \\n\",\n",

Because your ReplicationController manages pods\\nthat have the app=kubia label, you need to either remove this label or change its value\\nto move the pod out of the ReplicationController’s scope.

Because it’s incredibly simple to change the desired number of rep-\\nlicas, this also means scaling pods horizontally is trivial. \\n Scaling the number of pods up or down is as easy as changing the value of the rep-\\nlicas field in the ReplicationController resource. After the change, the Replication-\\nController will either see too many pods exist (when scaling down) and delete part of\\nthem, or see too few of them (when scaling up) and create additional pods. \\nSCALING UP A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nYour ReplicationController has been keeping three instances of your pod running.\\nYou’re going to scale that number up to 10 now. As you may remember, you’ve\\nalready scaled a ReplicationController in chapter 2. You could use the same com-\\nmand as before:\\n$ kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=10\\nBut you’ll do it differently this time. \\nSCALING A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER BY EDITING ITS DEFINITION\\nInstead of using the kubectl scale command, you’re going to scale it in a declarative\\nway by editing the ReplicationController’s definition:\\n$ kubectl edit rc kubia\\nWhen the text editor opens, find the spec.replicas field and change its value to 10,\\nas shown in the following listing.\\n# Please edit the object below. Lines beginning with a \\'#\\' will be ignored,\\n# and an empty file will abort the edit. If an error occurs while saving \\n# this file will be reopened with the relevant failures.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ReplicationController\\nConfiguring kubectl edit to use a different text editor\\nYou can tell kubectl to use a text editor of your choice by setting the KUBE_EDITOR\\nenvironment variable. For example, if you’d like to use nano for editing Kubernetes\\nresources, execute the following command (or put it into your ~/.bashrc or an\\nequivalent file):\\nexport KUBE_EDITOR=\"/usr/bin/nano\"\\nIf the KUBE_EDITOR environment variable isn’t set, kubectl edit falls back to using\\nthe default editor, usually configured through the EDITOR environment variable.\\nListing 4.7\\nEditing the RC in a text editor by running kubectl edit\\n \\n',\n",

You can use the kubectl scale command:\\n$ kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=3\\nAll this command does is modify the spec.replicas field of the ReplicationController’s\\ndefinition—like when you changed it through kubectl edit. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE DECLARATIVE APPROACH TO SCALING\\nHorizontally scaling pods in Kubernetes is a matter of stating your desire: “I want to\\nhave x number of instances running.” You’re not telling Kubernetes what or how to do\\nit. You’re just specifying the desired state. \\n This declarative approach makes interacting with a Kubernetes cluster easy.

In any case, you should understand ReplicaSets, so let’s see how they dif-\\nfer from ReplicationControllers.\\n4.3.1\\nComparing a ReplicaSet to a ReplicationController\\nA ReplicaSet behaves exactly like a ReplicationController, but it has more expressive\\npod selectors. Whereas a ReplicationController’s label selector only allows matching\\npods that include a certain label, a ReplicaSet’s selector also allows matching pods\\nthat lack a certain label or pods that include a certain label key, regardless of\\nits value.\\n Also, for example, a single ReplicationController can’t match pods with the label\\nenv=production and those with the label env=devel at the same time. It can only match\\neither pods with the env=production label or pods with the env=devel label. But a sin-\\ngle ReplicaSet can match both sets of pods and treat them as a single group. \\n Similarly, a ReplicationController can’t match pods based merely on the presence\\nof a label key, regardless of its value, whereas a ReplicaSet can. For example, a Replica-\\nSet can match all pods that include a label with the key env, whatever its actual value is\\n(you can think of it as env=*).\\n4.3.2\\nDefining a ReplicaSet\\nYou’re going to create a ReplicaSet now to see how the orphaned pods that were cre-\\nated by your ReplicationController and then abandoned earlier can now be adopted\\nby a ReplicaSet. First, you’ll rewrite your ReplicationController into a ReplicaSet by\\ncreating a new file called kubia-replicaset.yaml with the contents in the following\\nlisting.\\napiVersion: apps/v1beta2      \\nkind: ReplicaSet                    \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:                 \\n      app: kubia                 \\n  template:                        \\n    metadata:                      \\n      labels:                      \\n        app: kubia                 \\n    spec:                          \\n      containers:                  \\n      - name: kubia                \\n        image: luksa/kubia         \\nListing 4.8\\nA YAML definition of a ReplicaSet: kubia-replicaset.yaml\\nReplicaSets aren’t part of the v1 \\nAPI, but belong to the apps API \\ngroup and version v1beta2.\\nYou’re using the simpler matchLabels \\nselector here, which is much like a \\nReplicationController’s selector.\\nThe template is \\nthe same as in the \\nReplicationController.\\n \\n',\n",

You’re creating a\\nresource of type ReplicaSet which has much the same contents as the Replication-\\nController you created earlier. \\n The only difference is in the selector. Instead of listing labels the pods need to\\nhave directly under the selector property, you’re specifying them under selector\\n.matchLabels. This is the simpler (and less expressive) way of defining label selectors\\nin a ReplicaSet. Later, you’ll look at the more expressive option, as well.\\nBecause you still have three pods matching the app=kubia selector running from ear-\\nlier, creating this ReplicaSet will not cause any new pods to be created. The ReplicaSet\\nwill take those existing three pods under its wing. \\n4.3.3\\nCreating and examining a ReplicaSet\\nCreate the ReplicaSet from the YAML file with the kubectl create command.

On Kubernetes nodes, you can\\nstill use systemd to run your system processes, but then you can’t take advantage of all\\nthe features Kubernetes provides. \\n4.4.1\\nUsing a DaemonSet to run a pod on every node\\nTo run a pod on all cluster nodes, you create a DaemonSet object, which is much\\nlike a ReplicationController or a ReplicaSet, except that pods created by a Daemon-\\nSet already have a target node specified and skip the Kubernetes Scheduler. They\\naren’t scattered around the cluster randomly. \\n A DaemonSet makes sure it creates as many pods as there are nodes and deploys\\neach one on its own node, as shown in figure 4.8.\\n Whereas a ReplicaSet (or ReplicationController) makes sure that a desired num-\\nber of pod replicas exist in the cluster, a DaemonSet doesn’t have any notion of a\\ndesired replica count. It doesn’t need it because its job is to ensure that a pod match-\\ning its pod selector is running on each node. \\n If a node goes down, the DaemonSet doesn’t cause the pod to be created else-\\nwhere. But when a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet immediately\\ndeploys a new pod instance to it. It also does the same if someone inadvertently\\ndeletes one of the pods, leaving the node without the DaemonSet’s pod. Like a Replica-\\nSet, a DaemonSet creates the pod from the pod template configured in it.\\n4.4.2\\nUsing a DaemonSet to run pods only on certain nodes\\nA DaemonSet deploys pods to all nodes in the cluster, unless you specify that the pods\\nshould only run on a subset of all the nodes. This is done by specifying the node-\\nSelector property in the pod template, which is part of the DaemonSet definition\\n(similar to the pod template in a ReplicaSet or ReplicationController). \\n You’ve already used node selectors to deploy a pod onto specific nodes in chapter 3.\\nA node selector in a DaemonSet is similar—it defines the nodes the DaemonSet must\\ndeploy its pods to. \\nNOTE\\nLater in the book, you’ll learn that nodes can be made unschedulable,\\npreventing pods from being deployed to them. A DaemonSet will deploy pods\\neven to such nodes, because the unschedulable attribute is only used by the\\nScheduler, whereas pods managed by a DaemonSet bypass the Scheduler\\ncompletely. This is usually desirable, because DaemonSets are meant to run\\nsystem services, which usually need to run even on unschedulable nodes.\\nEXPLAINING DAEMONSETS WITH AN EXAMPLE\\nLet’s imagine having a daemon called ssd-monitor that needs to run on all nodes\\nthat contain a solid-state drive (SSD). You’ll create a DaemonSet that runs this dae-\\nmon on all nodes that are marked as having an SSD. The cluster administrators have\\nadded the disk=ssd label to all such nodes, so you’ll create the DaemonSet with a\\nnode selector that only selects nodes with that label, as shown in figure 4.9.\\n \\n',\n",

You’ll have\\ncases where you only want to run a task that terminates after completing its work.\\nReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, and DaemonSets run continuous tasks that are\\nnever considered completed. Processes in such pods are restarted when they exit. But\\nin a completable task, after its process terminates, it should not be restarted again. \\n4.5.1\\nIntroducing the Job resource\\nKubernetes includes support for this through the Job resource, which is similar to the\\nother resources we’ve discussed in this chapter, but it allows you to run a pod whose\\ncontainer isn’t restarted when the process running inside finishes successfully. Once it\\ndoes, the pod is considered complete. \\n In the event of a node failure, the pods on that node that are managed by a Job will\\nbe rescheduled to other nodes the way ReplicaSet pods are. In the event of a failure of\\nthe process itself (when the process returns an error exit code), the Job can be config-\\nured to either restart the container or not.\\n Figure 4.10 shows how a pod created by a Job is rescheduled to a new node if the\\nnode it was initially scheduled to fails. The figure also shows both a managed pod,\\nwhich isn’t rescheduled, and a pod backed by a ReplicaSet, which is.\\n For example, Jobs are useful for ad hoc tasks, where it’s crucial that the task fin-\\nishes properly. You could run the task in an unmanaged pod and wait for it to finish,\\nbut in the event of a node failing or the pod being evicted from the node while it is\\nperforming its task, you’d need to manually recreate it.

Because\\nthis is the cluster IP, it’s only accessible from inside the cluster. The primary purpose\\nof services is exposing groups of pods to other pods in the cluster, but you’ll usually\\nalso want to expose services externally. You’ll see how to do that later. For now, let’s\\nuse your service from inside the cluster and see what it does.\\nTESTING YOUR SERVICE FROM WITHIN THE CLUSTER\\nYou can send requests to your service from within the cluster in a few ways:\\n\\uf0a1The obvious way is to create a pod that will send the request to the service’s\\ncluster IP and log the response. You can then examine the pod’s log to see\\nwhat the service’s response was.\\n\\uf0a1You can ssh into one of the Kubernetes nodes and use the curl command.\\n\\uf0a1You can execute the curl command inside one of your existing pods through\\nthe kubectl exec command.\\nLet’s go for the last option, so you also learn how to run commands in existing pods. \\nREMOTELY EXECUTING COMMANDS IN RUNNING CONTAINERS\\nThe kubectl exec command allows you to remotely run arbitrary commands inside\\nan existing container of a pod. This comes in handy when you want to examine the\\ncontents, state, and/or environment of a container. List the pods with the kubectl\\nget pods command and choose one as your target for the exec command (in the fol-\\nlowing example, I’ve chosen the kubia-7nog1 pod as the target). You’ll also need to\\nobtain the cluster IP of your service (using kubectl get svc, for example). When run-\\nning the following commands yourself, be sure to replace the pod name and the ser-\\nvice IP with your own: \\n$ kubectl exec kubia-7nog1 -- curl -s http://10.111.249.153\\nYou’ve hit kubia-gzwli\\nIf you’ve used ssh to execute commands on a remote system before, you’ll recognize\\nthat kubectl exec isn’t much different.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nHere’s your \\nservice.\\n \\n',\n",

You instructed Kubernetes to execute the curl command inside the\\ncontainer of one of your pods. Curl sent an HTTP request to the service IP, which is\\nbacked by three pods. The Kubernetes service proxy intercepted the connection,\\nselected a random pod among the three pods, and forwarded the request to it. Node.js\\nrunning inside that pod then handled the request and returned an HTTP response con-\\ntaining the pod’s name. Curl then printed the response to the standard output, which\\nwas intercepted and printed to its standard output on your local machine by kubectl.\\nWhy the double dash?\\nThe double dash (--) in the command signals the end of command options for\\nkubectl. Everything after the double dash is the command that should be executed\\ninside the pod. Using the double dash isn’t necessary if the command has no\\narguments that start with a dash. But in your case, if you don’t use the double dash\\nthere, the -s option would be interpreted as an option for kubectl exec and would\\nresult in the following strange and highly misleading error:\\n$ kubectl exec kubia-7nog1 curl -s http://10.111.249.153\\nThe connection to the server 10.111.249.153 was refused – did you \\nspecify the right host or port?\\nThis has nothing to do with your service refusing the connection. It’s because\\nkubectl is not able to connect to an API server at 10.111.249.153 (the -s option\\nis used to tell kubectl to connect to a different API server than the default).\\n3.

This isn’t much different from the actual main pro-\\ncess in the container talking to the service.\\nCONFIGURING SESSION AFFINITY ON THE SERVICE\\nIf you execute the same command a few more times, you should hit a different pod\\nwith every invocation, because the service proxy normally forwards each connection\\nto a randomly selected backing pod, even if the connections are coming from the\\nsame client. \\n If, on the other hand, you want all requests made by a certain client to be redi-\\nrected to the same pod every time, you can set the service’s sessionAffinity property\\nto ClientIP (instead of None, which is the default), as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service             \\nspec:\\n  sessionAffinity: ClientIP\\n  ...\\nThis makes the service proxy redirect all requests originating from the same client IP\\nto the same pod. As an exercise, you can create an additional service with session affin-\\nity set to ClientIP and try sending requests to it.\\n Kubernetes supports only two types of service session affinity: None and ClientIP.\\nYou may be surprised it doesn’t have a cookie-based session affinity option, but you\\nneed to understand that Kubernetes services don’t operate at the HTTP level. Services\\ndeal with TCP and UDP packets and don’t care about the payload they carry. Because\\ncookies are a construct of the HTTP protocol, services don’t know about them, which\\nexplains why session affinity cannot be based on cookies. \\nEXPOSING MULTIPLE PORTS IN THE SAME SERVICE\\nYour service exposes only a single port, but services can also support multiple ports. For\\nexample, if your pods listened on two ports—let’s say 8080 for HTTP and 8443 for\\nHTTPS—you could use a single service to forward both port 80 and 443 to the pod’s\\nports 8080 and 8443. You don’t need to create two different services in such cases. Using\\na single, multi-port service exposes all the service’s ports through a single cluster IP.\\nNOTE\\nWhen creating a service with multiple ports, you must specify a name\\nfor each port.\\nThe spec for a multi-port service is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service             \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia              \\nListing 5.2\\nA example of a service with ClientIP session affinity configured\\nListing 5.3\\nSpecifying multiple ports in a service definition\\n \\n',\n",

The biggest benefit of doing so is\\nthat it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service\\nspec. Your pod currently uses port 8080 for http, but what if you later decide you’d\\nlike to move that to port 80? \\n If you’re using named ports, all you need to do is change the port number in the\\npod spec (while keeping the port’s name unchanged). As you spin up pods with the\\nnew ports, client connections will be forwarded to the appropriate port numbers,\\ndepending on the pod receiving the connection (port 8080 on old pods and port 80\\non the new ones).\\n5.1.2\\nDiscovering services\\nBy creating a service, you now have a single and stable IP address and port that you\\ncan hit to access your pods. This address will remain unchanged throughout the\\nwhole lifetime of the service. Pods behind this service may come and go, their IPs may\\nchange, their number can go up or down, but they’ll always be accessible through the\\nservice’s single and constant IP address. \\n But how do the client pods know the IP and port of a service? Do you need to cre-\\nate the service first, then manually look up its IP address and pass the IP to the config-\\nuration options of the client pod? Not really. Kubernetes also provides ways for client\\npods to discover a service’s IP and port.\\nDISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\\nWhen a pod is started, Kubernetes initializes a set of environment variables pointing\\nto each service that exists at that moment. If you create the service before creating the\\nclient pods, processes in those pods can get the IP address and port of the service by\\ninspecting their environment variables. \\n Let’s see what those environment variables look like by examining the environment\\nof one of your running pods. You’ve already learned that you can use the kubectl exec\\ncommand to run a command in the pod, but because you created the service only\\nafter your pods had been created, the environment variables for the service couldn’t\\nhave been set yet. You’ll need to address that first.\\n Before you can see environment variables for your service, you first need to delete\\nall the pods and let the ReplicationController create new ones. You may remember\\nyou can delete all pods without specifying their names like this:\\n$ kubectl delete po --all\\npod \"kubia-7nog1\" deleted\\npod \"kubia-bf50t\" deleted\\npod \"kubia-gzwli\" deleted\\nNow you can list the new pods (I’m sure you know how to do that) and pick one as\\nyour target for the kubectl exec command. Once you’ve selected your target pod,\\nyou can list environment variables by running the env command inside the container,\\nas shown in the following listing.\\n \\n',\n",

Among the variables that pertain to the\\nkubia service you created at the beginning of the chapter, you’ll see the KUBIA_SERVICE\\n_HOST and the KUBIA_SERVICE_PORT environment variables, which hold the IP address\\nand port of the kubia service, respectively. \\n Turning back to the frontend-backend example we started this chapter with, when\\nyou have a frontend pod that requires the use of a backend database server pod, you\\ncan expose the backend pod through a service called backend-database and then\\nhave the frontend pod look up its IP address and port through the environment vari-\\nables BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_HOST and BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_PORT.\\nNOTE\\nDashes in the service name are converted to underscores and all let-\\nters are uppercased when the service name is used as the prefix in the envi-\\nronment variable’s name. \\nEnvironment variables are one way of looking up the IP and port of a service, but isn’t\\nthis usually the domain of DNS? Why doesn’t Kubernetes include a DNS server and\\nallow you to look up service IPs through DNS instead? As it turns out, it does!\\nDISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH DNS\\nRemember in chapter 3 when you listed pods in the kube-system namespace? One of\\nthe pods was called kube-dns. The kube-system namespace also includes a corre-\\nsponding service with the same name.\\n As the name suggests, the pod runs a DNS server, which all other pods running in\\nthe cluster are automatically configured to use (Kubernetes does that by modifying\\neach container’s /etc/resolv.conf file). Any DNS query performed by a process run-\\nning in a pod will be handled by Kubernetes’ own DNS server, which knows all the ser-\\nvices running in your system. \\nNOTE\\nWhether a pod uses the internal DNS server or not is configurable\\nthrough the dnsPolicy property in each pod’s spec.\\nEach service gets a DNS entry in the internal DNS server, and client pods that know\\nthe name of the service can access it through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\\ninstead of resorting to environment variables. \\nListing 5.6\\nService-related environment variables in a container\\nHere’s the cluster \\nIP of the service.\\nAnd here’s the port the \\nservice is available on.\\n \\n',\n",

If the service is\\nusing a standard port (for example, 80 for HTTP or 5432 for Postgres), that\\nshouldn’t be a problem. If not, the client can get the port number from the\\nenvironment variable.\\nConnecting to a service can be even simpler than that. You can omit the svc.cluster\\n.local suffix and even the namespace, when the frontend pod is in the same name-\\nspace as the database pod. You can thus refer to the service simply as backend-\\ndatabase. That’s incredibly simple, right?\\n Let’s try this. You’ll try to access the kubia service through its FQDN instead of its\\nIP. Again, you’ll need to do that inside an existing pod. You already know how to use\\nkubectl exec to run a single command in a pod’s container, but this time, instead of\\nrunning the curl command directly, you’ll run the bash shell instead, so you can then\\nrun multiple commands in the container. This is similar to what you did in chapter 2\\nwhen you entered the container you ran with Docker by using the docker exec -it\\nbash command. \\nRUNNING A SHELL IN A POD’S CONTAINER\\nYou can use the kubectl exec command to run bash (or any other shell) inside a\\npod’s container. This way you’re free to explore the container as long as you want,\\nwithout having to perform a kubectl exec for every command you want to run.\\nNOTE\\nThe shell’s binary executable must be available in the container image\\nfor this to work.\\nTo use the shell properly, you need to pass the -it option to kubectl exec:\\n$ kubectl exec -it kubia-3inly bash\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# \\nYou’re now inside the container.

You know how to create services now, so you’ll soon\\ncreate your own. But what if, for whatever reason, you can’t access your service?\\n You’ll probably try to figure out what’s wrong by entering an existing pod and try-\\ning to access the service like you did in the last example. Then, if you still can’t access\\nthe service with a simple curl command, maybe you’ll try to ping the service IP to see\\nif it’s up. Let’s try that now:\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# ping kubia\\nPING kubia.default.svc.cluster.local (10.111.249.153): 56 data bytes\\n^C--- kubia.default.svc.cluster.local ping statistics ---\\n54 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss\\nHmm. curl-ing the service works, but pinging it doesn’t. That’s because the service’s\\ncluster IP is a virtual IP, and only has meaning when combined with the service port.\\nWe’ll explain what that means and how services work in chapter 11. I wanted to men-\\ntion that here because it’s the first thing users do when they try to debug a broken\\nservice and it catches most of them off guard.\\n5.2\\nConnecting to services living outside the cluster\\nUp to now, we’ve talked about services backed by one or more pods running inside\\nthe cluster. But cases exist when you’d like to expose external services through the\\nKubernetes services feature. Instead of having the service redirect connections to\\npods in the cluster, you want it to redirect to external IP(s) and port(s). \\n This allows you to take advantage of both service load balancing and service discov-\\nery. Client pods running in the cluster can connect to the external service like they\\nconnect to internal services.\\n5.2.1\\nIntroducing service endpoints\\nBefore going into how to do this, let me first shed more light on services. Services\\ndon’t link to pods directly. Instead, a resource sits in between—the Endpoints\\nresource. You may have already noticed endpoints if you used the kubectl describe\\ncommand on your service, as shown in the following listing.\\n \\n',\n",

This means a service IP address can remain\\nconstant while the actual implementation of the service is changed. \\n5.2.3\\nCreating an alias for an external service\\nInstead of exposing an external service by manually configuring the service’s End-\\npoints, a simpler method allows you to refer to an external service by its fully qualified\\ndomain name (FQDN).\\nCREATING AN EXTERNALNAME SERVICE\\nTo create a service that serves as an alias for an external service, you create a Service\\nresource with the type field set to ExternalName. For example, let’s imagine there’s a\\npublic API available at api.somecompany.com. You can define a service that points to\\nit as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n  name: external-service\\nspec:\\n  type: ExternalName                       \\n  externalName: someapi.somecompany.com     \\n  ports:\\n  - port: 80\\nAfter the service is created, pods can connect to the external service through the\\nexternal-service.default.svc.cluster.local domain name (or even external-\\nservice) instead of using the service’s actual FQDN. This hides the actual service\\nname and its location from pods consuming the service, allowing you to modify the\\nservice definition and point it to a different service any time later, by only changing\\nthe externalName attribute or by changing the type back to ClusterIP and creating\\nan Endpoints object for the service—either manually or by specifying a label selector\\non the service and having it created automatically.\\n ExternalName services are implemented solely at the DNS level—a simple CNAME\\nDNS record is created for the service. Therefore, clients connecting to the service will\\nconnect to the external service directly, bypassing the service proxy completely. For\\nthis reason, these types of services don’t even get a cluster IP. \\nNOTE\\nA CNAME record points to a fully qualified domain name instead of a\\nnumeric IP address.\\n5.3\\nExposing services to external clients\\nUp to now, we’ve only talked about how services can be consumed by pods from inside\\nthe cluster. But you’ll also want to expose certain services, such as frontend webserv-\\ners, to the outside, so external clients can access them, as depicted in figure 5.5.\\nListing 5.10\\nAn ExternalName-type service: external-service-externalname.yaml\\nService type is set \\nto ExternalName\\nThe fully qualified domain \\nname of the actual service\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '135\\nExposing services to external clients\\nYou have a few ways to make a service accessible externally:\\n\\uf0a1Setting the service type to NodePort—For a NodePort service, each cluster node\\nopens a port on the node itself (hence the name) and redirects traffic received\\non that port to the underlying service. The service isn’t accessible only at the\\ninternal cluster IP and port, but also through a dedicated port on all nodes. \\n\\uf0a1Setting the service type to LoadBalancer, an extension of the NodePort type—This\\nmakes the service accessible through a dedicated load balancer, provisioned\\nfrom the cloud infrastructure Kubernetes is running on. The load balancer redi-\\nrects traffic to the node port across all the nodes. Clients connect to the service\\nthrough the load balancer’s IP.\\n\\uf0a1Creating an Ingress resource, a radically different mechanism for exposing multiple ser-\\nvices through a single IP address—It operates at the HTTP level (network layer 7)\\nand can thus offer more features than layer 4 services can. We’ll explain Ingress\\nresources in section 5.4. \\n5.3.1\\nUsing a NodePort service\\nThe first method of exposing a set of pods to external clients is by creating a service\\nand setting its type to NodePort. By creating a NodePort service, you make Kubernetes\\nreserve a port on all its nodes (the same port number is used across all of them) and\\nforward incoming connections to the pods that are part of the service. \\n This is similar to a regular service (their actual type is ClusterIP), but a NodePort\\nservice can be accessed not only through the service’s internal cluster IP, but also\\nthrough any node’s IP and the reserved node port. \\n This will make more sense when you try interacting with a NodePort service.\\nCREATING A NODEPORT SERVICE\\nYou’ll now create a NodePort service to see how you can use it. The following listing\\nshows the YAML for the service.\\n \\nKubernetes cluster\\nExternal client\\nService\\nPod\\nPod\\nPod\\nFigure 5.5\\nExposing a service to external clients\\n \\n',\n",

An\\nadditional network hop is required to reach the pod, but this may not always be\\ndesirable. \\n You can prevent this additional hop by configuring the service to redirect external\\ntraffic only to pods running on the node that received the connection. This is done by\\nsetting the externalTrafficPolicy field in the service’s spec section:\\nspec:\\n  externalTrafficPolicy: Local\\n  ...\\nIf a service definition includes this setting and an external connection is opened\\nthrough the service’s node port, the service proxy will choose a locally running pod. If\\nno local pods exist, the connection will hang (it won’t be forwarded to a random\\nglobal pod, the way connections are when not using the annotation). You therefore\\nneed to ensure the load balancer forwards connections only to nodes that have at\\nleast one such pod.\\n Using this annotation also has other drawbacks. Normally, connections are spread\\nevenly across all the pods, but when using this annotation, that’s no longer the case.\\n Imagine having two nodes and three pods. Let’s say node A runs one pod and\\nnode B runs the other two. If the load balancer spreads connections evenly across the\\ntwo nodes, the pod on node A will receive 50% of all connections, but the two pods on\\nnode B will only receive 25% each, as shown in figure 5.8.\\n \\n',\n",

But when the connection is received through a\\nnode port, the packets’ source IP is changed, because Source Network Address Trans-\\nlation (SNAT) is performed on the packets. \\n The backing pod can’t see the actual client’s IP, which may be a problem for some\\napplications that need to know the client’s IP. In the case of a web server, for example,\\nthis means the access log won’t show the browser’s IP.\\n The Local external traffic policy described in the previous section affects the pres-\\nervation of the client’s IP, because there’s no additional hop between the node receiv-\\ning the connection and the node hosting the target pod (SNAT isn’t performed).\\n5.4\\nExposing services externally through an Ingress \\nresource\\nYou’ve now seen two ways of exposing a service to clients outside the cluster, but\\nanother method exists—creating an Ingress resource.\\nDEFINITION\\nIngress (noun)—The act of going in or entering; the right to\\nenter; a means or place of entering; entryway. \\nLet me first explain why you need another way to access Kubernetes services from the\\noutside. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHY INGRESSES ARE NEEDED\\nOne important reason is that each LoadBalancer service requires its own load bal-\\nancer with its own public IP address, whereas an Ingress only requires one, even when\\nproviding access to dozens of services.

But what about HTTPS? Let’s take\\na quick look at how to configure Ingress to support TLS. \\nCREATING A TLS CERTIFICATE FOR THE INGRESS\\nWhen a client opens a TLS connection to an Ingress controller, the controller termi-\\nnates the TLS connection. The communication between the client and the controller\\nis encrypted, whereas the communication between the controller and the backend\\npod isn’t. The application running in the pod doesn’t need to support TLS. For exam-\\nple, if the pod runs a web server, it can accept only HTTP traffic and let the Ingress\\ncontroller take care of everything related to TLS. To enable the controller to do that,\\nyou need to attach a certificate and a private key to the Ingress. The two need to be\\nstored in a Kubernetes resource called a Secret, which is then referenced in the\\nIngress manifest. We’ll explain Secrets in detail in chapter 7. For now, you’ll create the\\nSecret without paying too much attention to it.\\n First, you need to create the private key and certificate:\\n$ openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048\\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj \\n➥ /CN=kubia.example.com\\nListing 5.15\\nIngress exposing multiple services on different hosts\\nRequests for \\nfoo.example.com will be \\nrouted to service foo.\\nRequests for \\nbar.example.com will be \\nrouted to service bar.\\n \\n',\n",

Such a detailed readiness probe, which\\ntakes the app’s specifics into account, is the app developer’s responsibility. \\nTYPES OF READINESS PROBES\\nLike liveness probes, three types of readiness probes exist:\\n\\uf0a1An Exec probe, where a process is executed. The container’s status is deter-\\nmined by the process’ exit status code.\\n\\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe, which sends an HTTP GET request to the container and\\nthe HTTP status code of the response determines whether the container is\\nready or not.\\n\\uf0a1A TCP Socket probe, which opens a TCP connection to a specified port of the\\ncontainer. If the connection is established, the container is considered ready.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE OPERATION OF READINESS PROBES\\nWhen a container is started, Kubernetes can be configured to wait for a configurable\\namount of time to pass before performing the first readiness check. After that, it\\ninvokes the probe periodically and acts based on the result of the readiness probe. If a\\npod reports that it’s not ready, it’s removed from the service. If the pod then becomes\\nready again, it’s re-added. \\n Unlike liveness probes, if a container fails the readiness check, it won’t be killed or\\nrestarted. This is an important distinction between liveness and readiness probes.\\nLiveness probes keep pods healthy by killing off unhealthy containers and replacing\\nthem with new, healthy ones, whereas readiness probes make sure that only pods that\\nare ready to serve requests receive them. This is mostly necessary during container\\nstart up, but it’s also useful after the container has been running for a while. \\n As you can see in figure 5.11, if a pod’s readiness probe fails, the pod is removed\\nfrom the Endpoints object. Clients connecting to the service will not be redirected to\\nthe pod.

If\\nat any point one of the frontend pods experiences connectivity problems and can’t\\nreach the database anymore, it may be wise for its readiness probe to signal to Kuber-\\nnetes that the pod isn’t ready to serve any requests at that time. If other pod instances\\naren’t experiencing the same type of connectivity issues, they can serve requests nor-\\nmally. A readiness probe makes sure clients only talk to those healthy pods and never\\nnotice there’s anything wrong with the system.\\n5.5.2\\nAdding a readiness probe to a pod\\nNext you’ll add a readiness probe to your existing pods by modifying the Replication-\\nController’s pod template. \\nADDING A READINESS PROBE TO THE POD TEMPLATE\\nYou’ll use the kubectl edit command to add the probe to the pod template in your\\nexisting ReplicationController:\\n$ kubectl edit rc kubia\\nWhen the ReplicationController’s YAML opens in the text editor, find the container\\nspecification in the pod template and add the following readiness probe definition to\\nthe first container under spec.template.spec.containers.

As you may remem-\\nber from the previous chapter, changing a ReplicationController’s pod template has\\nno effect on existing pods. \\n In other words, all your existing pods still have no readiness probe defined. You\\ncan see this by listing the pods with kubectl get pods and looking at the READY col-\\numn. You need to delete the pods and have them re-created by the Replication-\\nController. The new pods will fail the readiness check and won’t be included as\\nendpoints of the service until you create the /var/ready file in each of them. \\nOBSERVING AND MODIFYING THE PODS’ READINESS STATUS\\nList the pods again and inspect whether they’re ready or not:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-2r1qb   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nkubia-3rax1   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nkubia-3yw4s   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nThe READY column shows that none of the containers are ready. Now make the readi-\\nness probe of one of them start returning success by creating the /var/ready file,\\nwhose existence makes your mock readiness probe succeed:\\n$ kubectl exec kubia-2r1qb -- touch /var/ready\\nYou’ve used the kubectl exec command to execute the touch command inside the\\ncontainer of the kubia-2r1qb pod. The touch command creates the file if it doesn’t\\nyet exist. The pod’s readiness probe command should now exit with status code 0,\\nwhich means the probe is successful, and the pod should now be shown as ready. Let’s\\nsee if it is:\\n$ kubectl get po kubia-2r1qb\\nNAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-2r1qb   0/1       Running   0          2m\\nThe pod still isn’t ready.

The output should contain\\nthe following line:\\nReadiness: exec [ls /var/ready] delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1\\n➥ #failure=3\\nThe readiness probe is checked periodically—every 10 seconds by default. The pod\\nisn’t ready because the readiness probe hasn’t been invoked yet.

Clients will therefore see “Connection refused” types of errors. \\nTIP\\nYou should always define a readiness probe, even if it’s as simple as send-\\ning an HTTP request to the base URL. \\nDON’T INCLUDE POD SHUTDOWN LOGIC INTO YOUR READINESS PROBES\\nThe other thing I need to mention applies to the other end of the pod’s life (pod\\nshutdown) and is also related to clients experiencing connection errors. \\n When a pod is being shut down, the app running in it usually stops accepting con-\\nnections as soon as it receives the termination signal. Because of this, you might think\\nyou need to make your readiness probe start failing as soon as the shutdown proce-\\ndure is initiated, ensuring the pod is removed from all services it’s part of. But that’s\\nnot necessary, because Kubernetes removes the pod from all services as soon as you\\ndelete the pod.\\n \\n',\n",

Each connection to the\\nservice is forwarded to one randomly selected backing pod. But what if the client\\nneeds to connect to all of those pods? What if the backing pods themselves need to\\neach connect to all the other backing pods? Connecting through the service clearly\\nisn’t the way to do this. What is?\\n For a client to connect to all pods, it needs to figure out the the IP of each individ-\\nual pod. One option is to have the client call the Kubernetes API server and get the\\nlist of pods and their IP addresses through an API call, but because you should always\\nstrive to keep your apps Kubernetes-agnostic, using the API server isn’t ideal. \\n Luckily, Kubernetes allows clients to discover pod IPs through DNS lookups. Usually,\\nwhen you perform a DNS lookup for a service, the DNS server returns a single IP—the\\nservice’s cluster IP. But if you tell Kubernetes you don’t need a cluster IP for your service\\n(you do this by setting the clusterIP field to None in the service specification), the DNS\\nserver will return the pod IPs instead of the single service IP.\\n Instead of returning a single DNS A record, the DNS server will return multiple A\\nrecords for the service, each pointing to the IP of an individual pod backing the ser-\\nvice at that moment. Clients can therefore do a simple DNS A record lookup and get\\nthe IPs of all the pods that are part of the service. The client can then use that infor-\\nmation to connect to one, many, or all of them.\\n5.6.1\\nCreating a headless service\\nSetting the clusterIP field in a service spec to None makes the service headless, as\\nKubernetes won’t assign it a cluster IP through which clients could connect to the\\npods backing it. \\n You’ll create a headless service called kubia-headless now. The following listing\\nshows its definition.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia-headless\\nspec:\\n  clusterIP: None       \\n  ports:\\n  - port: 80\\n    targetPort: 8080\\n  selector:\\n    app: kubia\\nAfter you create the service with kubectl create, you can inspect it with kubectl get\\nand kubectl describe.

You’ll need to perform the lookup from inside one of the pods.\\nUnfortunately, your kubia container image doesn’t include the nslookup (or the dig)\\nbinary, so you can’t use it to perform the DNS lookup.\\n All you’re trying to do is perform a DNS lookup from inside a pod running in the\\ncluster. Why not run a new pod based on an image that contains the binaries you\\nneed? To perform DNS-related actions, you can use the tutum/dnsutils container\\nimage, which is available on Docker Hub and contains both the nslookup and the dig\\nbinaries. To run the pod, you can go through the whole process of creating a YAML\\nmanifest for it and passing it to kubectl create, but that’s too much work, right?\\nLuckily, there’s a faster way.\\nRUNNING A POD WITHOUT WRITING A YAML MANIFEST\\nIn chapter 1, you already created pods without writing a YAML manifest by using the\\nkubectl run command. But this time you want to create only a pod—you don’t need\\nto create a ReplicationController to manage the pod. You can do that like this:\\n$ kubectl run dnsutils --image=tutum/dnsutils --generator=run-pod/v1\\n➥ --command -- sleep infinity\\npod \"dnsutils\" created\\nThe trick is in the --generator=run-pod/v1 option, which tells kubectl to create the\\npod directly, without any kind of ReplicationController or similar behind it. \\nUNDERSTANDING DNS A RECORDS RETURNED FOR A HEADLESS SERVICE\\nLet’s use the newly created pod to perform a DNS lookup:\\n$ kubectl exec dnsutils nslookup kubia-headless\\n...\\nName:    kubia-headless.default.svc.cluster.local\\nAddress: 10.108.1.4 \\nName:    kubia-headless.default.svc.cluster.local\\nAddress: 10.108.2.5 \\nThe DNS server returns two different IPs for the kubia-headless.default.svc\\n.cluster.local FQDN. Those are the IPs of the two pods that are reporting being\\nready. You can confirm this by listing pods with kubectl get pods -o wide, which\\nshows the pods’ IPs. \\n \\n',\n",

Even with a headless service, clients can con-\\nnect to its pods by connecting to the service’s DNS name, as they can with regular ser-\\nvices. But with headless services, because DNS returns the pods’ IPs, clients connect\\ndirectly to the pods, instead of through the service proxy. \\nNOTE\\nA headless services still provides load balancing across pods, but through\\nthe DNS round-robin mechanism instead of through the service proxy.\\n5.6.3\\nDiscovering all pods—even those that aren’t ready\\nYou’ve seen that only pods that are ready become endpoints of services. But some-\\ntimes you want to use the service discovery mechanism to find all pods matching the\\nservice’s label selector, even those that aren’t ready. \\n Luckily, you don’t have to resort to querying the Kubernetes API server. You can\\nuse the DNS lookup mechanism to find even those unready pods. To tell Kubernetes\\nyou want all pods added to a service, regardless of the pod’s readiness status, you must\\nadd the following annotation to the service:\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n  annotations:\\n    service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints: \"true\"\\nWARNING\\nAs the annotation name suggests, as I’m writing this, this is an alpha\\nfeature. The Kubernetes Service API already supports a new service spec field\\ncalled publishNotReadyAddresses, which will replace the tolerate-unready-\\nendpoints annotation. In Kubernetes version 1.9.0, the field is not honored yet\\n(the annotation is what determines whether unready endpoints are included in\\nthe DNS or not). Check the documentation to see whether that’s changed.\\n5.7\\nTroubleshooting services\\nServices are a crucial Kubernetes concept and the source of frustration for many\\ndevelopers.

Combine this with the fact that containers in a pod get restarted (either\\nbecause the process died or because the liveness probe signaled to Kubernetes that\\nthe container wasn’t healthy anymore) and you’ll realize that the new container will\\nnot see anything that was written to the filesystem by the previous container, even\\nthough the newly started container runs in the same pod.\\n In certain scenarios you want the new container to continue where the last one fin-\\nished, such as when restarting a process on a physical machine. You may not need (or\\nwant) the whole filesystem to be persisted, but you do want to preserve the directories\\nthat hold actual data.\\n Kubernetes provides this by defining storage volumes. They aren’t top-level resources\\nlike pods, but are instead defined as a part of a pod and share the same lifecycle as the\\npod. This means a volume is created when the pod is started and is destroyed when\\nthe pod is deleted. Because of this, a volume’s contents will persist across container\\nrestarts. After a container is restarted, the new container can see all the files that were\\nwritten to the volume by the previous container. Also, if a pod contains multiple con-\\ntainers, the volume can be used by all of them at once. \\n6.1\\nIntroducing volumes\\nKubernetes volumes are a component of a pod and are thus defined in the pod’s spec-\\nification—much like containers. They aren’t a standalone Kubernetes object and can-\\nnot be created or deleted on their own. A volume is available to all containers in the\\npod, but it must be mounted in each container that needs to access it. In each con-\\ntainer, you can mount the volume in any location of its filesystem.\\n6.1.1\\nExplaining volumes in an example\\nImagine you have a pod with three containers (shown in figure 6.1). One container\\nruns a web server that serves HTML pages from the /var/htdocs directory and stores\\nthe access log to /var/logs. The second container runs an agent that creates HTML\\nfiles and stores them in /var/html. The third container processes the logs it finds in\\nthe /var/logs directory (rotates them, compresses them, analyzes them, or whatever).\\n Each container has a nicely defined single responsibility, but on its own each con-\\ntainer wouldn’t be of much use. Creating a pod with these three containers without\\nthem sharing disk storage doesn’t make any sense, because the content generator\\nwould write the generated HTML files inside its own container and the web server\\ncouldn’t access those files, as it runs in a separate isolated container. Instead, it would\\nserve an empty directory or whatever you put in the /var/htdocs directory in its con-\\ntainer image. Similarly, the log rotator would never have anything to do, because its\\n/var/logs directory would always remain empty with nothing writing logs there. A pod\\nwith these three containers and no volumes basically does nothing.\\n But if you add two volumes to the pod and mount them at appropriate paths inside\\nthe three containers, as shown in figure 6.2, you’ve created a system that’s much more\\n \\n',\n",

When you do that, the contents of the mounted filesystem are accessi-\\nble in the directory it’s mounted into. By mounting the same volume into two contain-\\ners, they can operate on the same files. In your case, you’re mounting two volumes in\\nthree containers. By doing this, your three containers can work together and do some-\\nthing useful. Let me explain how.\\n First, the pod has a volume called publicHtml. This volume is mounted in the Web-\\nServer container at /var/htdocs, because that’s the directory the web server serves\\nfiles from. The same volume is also mounted in the ContentAgent container, but at\\n/var/html, because that’s where the agent writes the files to. By mounting this single vol-\\nume like that, the web server will now serve the content generated by the content agent.\\n Similarly, the pod also has a volume called logVol for storing logs. This volume is\\nmounted at /var/logs in both the WebServer and the LogRotator containers. Note\\nthat it isn’t mounted in the ContentAgent container. The container cannot access its\\nfiles, even though the container and the volume are part of the same pod. It’s not\\nenough to define a volume in the pod; you need to define a VolumeMount inside the\\ncontainer’s spec also, if you want the container to be able to access it.\\n The two volumes in this example can both initially be empty, so you can use a type\\nof volume called emptyDir. Kubernetes also supports other types of volumes that are\\neither populated during initialization of the volume from an external source, or an\\nexisting directory is mounted inside the volume. This process of populating or mount-\\ning a volume is performed before the pod’s containers are started. \\n A volume is bound to the lifecycle of a pod and will stay in existence only while the\\npod exists, but depending on the volume type, the volume’s files may remain intact\\neven after the pod and volume disappear, and can later be mounted into a new vol-\\nume. Let’s see what types of volumes exist.\\n6.1.2\\nIntroducing available volume types\\nA wide variety of volume types is available. Several are generic, while others are spe-\\ncific to the actual storage technologies used underneath. Don’t worry if you’ve never\\nheard of those technologies—I hadn’t heard of at least half of them. You’ll probably\\nonly use volume types for the technologies you already know and use. Here’s a list of\\nseveral of the available volume types:\\n\\uf0a1\\nemptyDir—A simple empty directory used for storing transient data.\\n\\uf0a1\\nhostPath—Used for mounting directories from the worker node’s filesystem\\ninto the pod.\\n\\uf0a1\\ngitRepo—A volume initialized by checking out the contents of a Git repository.\\n\\uf0a1\\nnfs—An NFS share mounted into the pod.\\n\\uf0a1\\ngcePersistentDisk (Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk), awsElastic-\\nBlockStore (Amazon Web Services Elastic Block Store Volume), azureDisk\\n(Microsoft Azure Disk Volume)—Used for mounting cloud provider-specific\\nstorage.\\n \\n',\n",

Special types of volumes (secret, downwardAPI, configMap) are\\ncovered in the next two chapters, because they aren’t used for storing data, but for\\nexposing Kubernetes metadata to apps running in the pod. \\n A single pod can use multiple volumes of different types at the same time, and, as\\nwe’ve mentioned before, each of the pod’s containers can either have the volume\\nmounted or not.\\n6.2\\nUsing volumes to share data between containers\\nAlthough a volume can prove useful even when used by a single container, let’s first\\nfocus on how it’s used for sharing data between multiple containers in a pod.\\n6.2.1\\nUsing an emptyDir volume\\nThe simplest volume type is the emptyDir volume, so let’s look at it in the first exam-\\nple of how to define a volume in a pod. As the name suggests, the volume starts out as\\nan empty directory. The app running inside the pod can then write any files it needs\\nto it. Because the volume’s lifetime is tied to that of the pod, the volume’s contents are\\nlost when the pod is deleted.\\n An emptyDir volume is especially useful for sharing files between containers\\nrunning in the same pod. But it can also be used by a single container for when a con-\\ntainer needs to write data to disk temporarily, such as when performing a sort\\noperation on a large dataset, which can’t fit into the available memory. The data could\\nalso be written to the container’s filesystem itself (remember the top read-write layer\\nin a container?), but subtle differences exist between the two options. A container’s\\nfilesystem may not even be writable (we’ll talk about this toward the end of the book),\\nso writing to a mounted volume might be the only option. \\nUSING AN EMPTYDIR VOLUME IN A POD\\nLet’s revisit the previous example where a web server, a content agent, and a log rota-\\ntor share two volumes, but let’s simplify a bit. You’ll build a pod with only the web\\nserver container and the content agent and a single volume for the HTML. \\n You’ll use Nginx as the web server and the UNIX fortune command to generate\\nthe HTML content. The fortune command prints out a random quote every time you\\nrun it. You’ll create a script that invokes the fortune command every 10 seconds and\\nstores its output in index.html.

The end effect is that a client sending an\\nHTTP request to the pod on port 80 will receive the current fortune message as\\nthe response. \\nSEEING THE POD IN ACTION\\nTo see the fortune message, you need to enable access to the pod. You’ll do that by\\nforwarding a port from your local machine to the pod:\\n$ kubectl port-forward fortune 8080:80\\nForwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80\\nForwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80\\nNOTE\\nAs an exercise, you can also expose the pod through a service instead\\nof using port forwarding.\\nNow you can access the Nginx server through port 8080 of your local machine. Use\\ncurl to do that:\\n$ curl http://localhost:8080\\nBeware of a tall blond man with one black shoe.\\nIf you wait a few seconds and send another request, you should receive a different\\nmessage. By combining two containers, you created a simple app to see how a volume\\ncan glue together two containers and enhance what each of them does.\\nThe first container is called html-generator \\nand runs the luksa/fortune image.\\nThe volume called html is mounted \\nat /var/htdocs in the container.\\nThe second container is called web-server \\nand runs the nginx:alpine image.\\nThe same volume as above is \\nmounted at /usr/share/nginx/html \\nas read-only.\\nA single emptyDir volume \\ncalled html that’s mounted \\nin the two containers above\\n \\n',\n",

To do this, set the emptyDir’s medium to Memory like this:\\nvolumes:\\n  - name: html\\n    emptyDir:\\n      medium: Memory    \\nAn emptyDir volume is the simplest type of volume, but other types build upon it.\\nAfter the empty directory is created, they populate it with data. One such volume type\\nis the gitRepo volume type, which we’ll introduce next.\\n6.2.2\\nUsing a Git repository as the starting point for a volume \\nA gitRepo volume is basically an emptyDir volume that gets populated by cloning a\\nGit repository and checking out a specific revision when the pod is starting up (but\\nbefore its containers are created). Figure 6.3 shows how this unfolds.\\nNOTE\\nAfter the gitRepo volume is created, it isn’t kept in sync with the repo\\nit’s referencing. The files in the volume will not be updated when you push\\nadditional commits to the Git repository. However, if your pod is managed by\\na ReplicationController, deleting the pod will result in a new pod being cre-\\nated and this new pod’s volume will then contain the latest commits. \\nFor example, you can use a Git repository to store static HTML files of your website\\nand create a pod containing a web server container and a gitRepo volume.

If you\\ndon’t use Git locally, you can edit the file on GitHub directly—click on the file in your\\nGitHub repository to open it and then click on the pencil icon to start editing it.\\nChange the text and then commit the changes by clicking the button at the bottom.\\n The master branch of the Git repository now includes the changes you made to the\\nHTML file. These changes will not be visible on your Nginx web server yet, because\\nthe gitRepo volume isn’t kept in sync with the Git repository. You can confirm this by\\nhitting the pod again. \\n To see the new version of the website, you need to delete the pod and create\\nit again. Instead of having to delete the pod every time you make changes, you could\\nrun an additional process, which keeps your volume in sync with the Git repository.\\nI won’t explain in detail how to do this. Instead, try doing this yourself as an exer-\\ncise, but here are a few pointers.\\nINTRODUCING SIDECAR CONTAINERS\\nThe Git sync process shouldn’t run in the same container as the Nginx web server, but\\nin a second container: a sidecar container. A sidecar container is a container that aug-\\nments the operation of the main container of the pod. You add a sidecar to a pod so\\nyou can use an existing container image instead of cramming additional logic into the\\nmain app’s code, which would make it overly complex and less reusable. \\n To find an existing container image, which keeps a local directory synchronized\\nwith a Git repository, go to Docker Hub and search for “git sync.” You’ll find many\\nimages that do that. Then use the image in a new container in the pod from the previ-\\nous example, mount the pod’s existing gitRepo volume in the new container, and\\nconfigure the Git sync container to keep the files in sync with your Git repo. If you set\\neverything up correctly, you should see that the files the web server is serving are kept\\nin sync with your GitHub repo. \\nNOTE\\nAn example in chapter 18 includes using a Git sync container like the\\none explained here, so you can wait until you reach chapter 18 and follow the\\nstep-by-step instructions then instead of doing this exercise on your own now. \\nUSING A GITREPO VOLUME WITH PRIVATE GIT REPOSITORIES\\nThere’s one other reason for having to resort to Git sync sidecar containers. We\\nhaven’t talked about whether you can use a gitRepo volume with a private Git repo. It\\nturns out you can’t. The current consensus among Kubernetes developers is to keep\\nthe gitRepo volume simple and not add any support for cloning private repositories\\nthrough the SSH protocol, because that would require adding additional config\\noptions to the gitRepo volume. \\n If you want to clone a private Git repo into your container, you should use a git-\\nsync sidecar or a similar method instead of a gitRepo volume.\\n \\n',\n",

When\\nthe pod is deleted, the volume and its contents are deleted. Other types of volumes,\\nhowever, don’t create a new directory, but instead mount an existing external direc-\\ntory into the pod’s container’s filesystem. The contents of that volume can survive\\nmultiple pod instantiations. We’ll learn about those types of volumes next.\\n6.3\\nAccessing files on the worker node’s filesystem\\nMost  pods should be oblivious of their host node, so they shouldn’t access any files on\\nthe node’s filesystem. But certain system-level pods (remember, these will usually be\\nmanaged by a DaemonSet) do need to either read the node’s files or use the node’s\\nfilesystem to access the node’s devices through the filesystem. Kubernetes makes this\\npossible through a hostPath volume. \\n6.3.1\\nIntroducing the hostPath volume\\nA hostPath volume points to a specific file or directory on the node’s filesystem (see\\nfigure 6.4). Pods running on the same node and using the same path in their host-\\nPath volume see the same files.\\nhostPath volumes are the first type of persistent storage we’re introducing, because\\nboth the gitRepo and emptyDir volumes’ contents get deleted when a pod is torn\\ndown, whereas a hostPath volume’s contents don’t. If a pod is deleted and the next\\npod uses a hostPath volume pointing to the same path on the host, the new pod will\\nsee whatever was left behind by the previous pod, but only if it’s scheduled to the same\\nnode as the first pod.\\nNode 1\\nPod\\nhostPath\\nvolume\\nPod\\nhostPath\\nvolume\\nNode 2\\nPod\\nhostPath\\nvolume\\n/some/path/on/host\\n/some/path/on/host\\nFigure 6.4\\nA hostPath volume mounts a file or directory on the worker node into \\nthe container’s filesystem.\\n \\n',\n",

Because the volume’s contents are stored on a specific\\nnode’s filesystem, when the database pod gets rescheduled to another node, it will no\\nlonger see the data. This explains why it’s not a good idea to use a hostPath volume\\nfor regular pods, because it makes the pod sensitive to what node it’s scheduled to.\\n6.3.2\\nExamining system pods that use hostPath volumes\\nLet’s see how a hostPath volume can be used properly. Instead of creating a new pod,\\nlet’s see if any existing system-wide pods are already using this type of volume. As you\\nmay remember from one of the previous chapters, several such pods are running in\\nthe kube-system namespace. Let’s list them again:\\n$ kubectl get pod s --namespace kube-system\\nNAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nfluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-9a3e   1/1       Running   1          4d\\nfluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-e2vz   1/1       Running   1          31d\\n...\\nPick the first one and see what kinds of volumes it uses (shown in the following listing).\\n$ kubectl describe po fluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-9a3e --namespace kube-system\\nName:           fluentd-cloud-logging-gke-kubia-default-pool-4ebc2f1e-9a3e\\nNamespace:      kube-system\\n...\\nVolumes:\\n  varlog:\\n    Type:       HostPath (bare host directory volume)\\n    Path:       /var/log\\n  varlibdockercontainers:\\n    Type:       HostPath (bare host directory volume)\\n    Path:       /var/lib/docker/containers\\nTIP\\nIf you’re using Minikube, try the kube-addon-manager-minikube pod.\\nAha! The pod uses two hostPath volumes to gain access to the node’s /var/log and\\nthe /var/lib/docker/containers directories. You’d think you were lucky to find a pod\\nusing a hostPath volume on the first try, but not really (at least not on GKE). Check\\nthe other pods, and you’ll see most use this type of volume either to access the node’s\\nlog files, kubeconfig (the Kubernetes config file), or the CA certificates.\\n If you inspect the other pods, you’ll see none of them uses the hostPath volume\\nfor storing their own data. They all use it to get access to the node’s data. But as we’ll\\nsee later in the chapter, hostPath volumes are often used for trying out persistent stor-\\nage in single-node clusters, such as the one created by Minikube. Read on to learn\\nabout the types of volumes you should use for storing persistent data properly even in\\na multi-node cluster.\\nListing 6.3\\n A pod using hostPath volumes to access the node’s logs\\n \\n',\n",

Never use them to persist data across pods. \\n6.4\\nUsing persistent storage\\nWhen an application running in a pod needs to persist data to disk and have that\\nsame data available even when the pod is rescheduled to another node, you can’t use\\nany of the volume types we’ve mentioned so far. Because this data needs to be accessi-\\nble from any cluster node, it must be stored on some type of network-attached stor-\\nage (NAS).\\n To learn about volumes that allow persisting data, you’ll create a pod that will run\\nthe MongoDB document-oriented NoSQL database. Running a database pod without\\na volume or with a non-persistent volume doesn’t make sense, except for testing\\npurposes, so you’ll add an appropriate type of volume to the pod and mount it in the\\nMongoDB container. \\n6.4.1\\nUsing a GCE Persistent Disk in a pod volume\\nIf you’ve been running these examples on Google Kubernetes Engine, which runs\\nyour cluster nodes on Google Compute Engine (GCE), you’ll use a GCE Persistent\\nDisk as your underlying storage mechanism. \\n In the early versions, Kubernetes didn’t provision the underlying storage automati-\\ncally—you had to do that manually. Automatic provisioning is now possible, and you’ll\\nlearn about it later in the chapter, but first, you’ll start by provisioning the storage\\nmanually. It will give you a chance to learn exactly what’s going on underneath. \\nCREATING A GCE PERSISTENT DISK\\nYou’ll start by creating the GCE persistent disk first. You need to create it in the same\\nzone as your Kubernetes cluster. If you don’t remember what zone you created the\\ncluster in, you can see it by listing your Kubernetes clusters with the gcloud command\\nlike this:\\n$ gcloud container clusters list\\nNAME   ZONE            MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP       ...\\nkubia  europe-west1-b  1.2.5           104.155.84.137  ...\\nThis shows you’ve created your cluster in zone europe-west1-b, so you need to create\\nthe GCE persistent disk in the same zone as well. You create the disk like this:\\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west1-b mongodb\\nWARNING: You have selected a disk size of under [200GB].

If\\nyou’re already familiar with a particular storage technology, using the explain com-\\nmand should allow you to easily figure out how to mount a volume of the proper type\\nand use it in your pods.\\n But does a developer need to know all this stuff? Should a developer, when creat-\\ning a pod, have to deal with infrastructure-related storage details, or should that be\\nleft to the cluster administrator? \\n Having a pod’s volumes refer to the actual underlying infrastructure isn’t what\\nKubernetes is about, is it? For example, for a developer to have to specify the host-\\nname of the NFS server feels wrong. And that’s not even the worst thing about it. \\n Including this type of infrastructure-related information into a pod definition\\nmeans the pod definition is pretty much tied to a specific Kubernetes cluster. You\\ncan’t use the same pod definition in another one. That’s why using volumes like this\\nisn’t the best way to attach persistent storage to your pods. You’ll learn how to improve\\non this in the next section.\\nListing 6.8\\nA pod using an nfs volume: mongodb-pod-nfs.yaml\\nSpecify the ID of the EBS \\nvolume you created.\\nThe filesystem type \\nis EXT4 as before.\\nThis volume is backed \\nby an NFS share.\\nThe IP of the \\nNFS server\\nThe path exported \\nby the server\\n \\n',\n",

For example, to create a NFS-backed volume, the developer has to know the actual\\nserver the NFS export is located on. This is against the basic idea of Kubernetes, which\\naims to hide the actual infrastructure from both the application and its developer, leav-\\ning them free from worrying about the specifics of the infrastructure and making apps\\nportable across a wide array of cloud providers and on-premises datacenters.\\n Ideally, a developer deploying their apps on Kubernetes should never have to\\nknow what kind of storage technology is used underneath, the same way they don’t\\nhave to know what type of physical servers are being used to run their pods. Infrastruc-\\nture-related dealings should be the sole domain of the cluster administrator.\\n When a developer needs a certain amount of persistent storage for their applica-\\ntion, they can request it from Kubernetes, the same way they can request CPU, mem-\\nory, and other resources when creating a pod. The system administrator can configure\\nthe cluster so it can give the apps what they request.\\n6.5.1\\nIntroducing PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims\\nTo enable apps to request storage in a Kubernetes cluster without having to deal with\\ninfrastructure specifics, two new resources were introduced. They are Persistent-\\nVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims. The names may be a bit misleading, because as\\nyou’ve seen in the previous few sections, even regular Kubernetes volumes can be\\nused to store persistent data. \\n Using a PersistentVolume inside a pod is a little more complex than using a regular\\npod volume, so let’s illustrate how pods, PersistentVolumeClaims, PersistentVolumes,\\nand the actual underlying storage relate to each other in figure 6.6.\\nPod\\nAdmin\\nVolume\\n1. Cluster admin sets up some type of\\nnetwork storage (NFS export or similar)\\n2.

When creating the PersistentVolume, the admin specifies its size and the access\\nmodes it supports. \\n When a cluster user needs to use persistent storage in one of their pods, they first\\ncreate a PersistentVolumeClaim manifest, specifying the minimum size and the access\\nmode they require. The user then submits the PersistentVolumeClaim manifest to the\\nKubernetes API server, and Kubernetes finds the appropriate PersistentVolume and\\nbinds the volume to the claim. \\n The PersistentVolumeClaim can then be used as one of the volumes inside a pod.\\nOther users cannot use the same PersistentVolume until it has been released by delet-\\ning the bound PersistentVolumeClaim.\\n6.5.2\\nCreating a PersistentVolume\\nLet’s revisit the MongoDB example, but unlike before, you won’t reference the GCE\\nPersistent Disk in the pod directly.

The developer then decides which one is most appropriate for\\neach claim they create. \\n The nice thing about StorageClasses is the fact that claims refer to them by\\nname. The PVC definitions are therefore portable across different clusters, as long\\nas the StorageClass names are the same across all of them. To see this portability\\nyourself, you can try running the same example on Minikube, if you’ve been using\\nGKE up to this point. As a cluster admin, you’ll have to create a different storage\\nclass (but with the same name). The storage class defined in the storageclass-fast-\\nhostpath.yaml file is tailor-made for use in Minikube. Then, once you deploy the stor-\\nage class, you as a cluster user can deploy the exact same PVC manifest and the exact\\nsame pod manifest as before. This shows how the pods and PVCs are portable across\\ndifferent clusters.\\n6.6.3\\nDynamic provisioning without specifying a storage class\\nAs we’ve progressed through this chapter, attaching persistent storage to pods has\\nbecome ever simpler. The sections in this chapter reflect how provisioning of storage\\nhas evolved from early Kubernetes versions to now. In this final section, we’ll look at\\nthe latest and simplest way of attaching a PersistentVolume to a pod. \\nLISTING STORAGE CLASSES\\nWhen you created your custom storage class called fast, you didn’t check if any exist-\\ning storage classes were already defined in your cluster. Why don’t you do that now?\\nHere are the storage classes available in GKE:\\n$ kubectl get sc\\nNAME                 TYPE\\nfast                 kubernetes.io/gce-pd\\nstandard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd\\nNOTE\\nWe’re using sc as shorthand for storageclass.\\nBeside the fast storage class, which you created yourself, a standard storage class\\nexists and is marked as default. You’ll learn what that means in a moment. Let’s list the\\nstorage classes available in Minikube, so we can compare:\\n$ kubectl get sc\\nNAME                 TYPE\\nfast                 k8s.io/minikube-hostpath\\nstandard (default)   k8s.io/minikube-hostpath\\nAgain, the fast storage class was created by you and a default standard storage class\\nexists here as well.

Because almost all apps require configuration (set-\\ntings that differ between deployed instances, credentials for accessing external sys-\\ntems, and so on), which shouldn’t be baked into the built app itself, let’s see how to\\npass configuration options to your app when running it in Kubernetes.\\n7.1\\nConfiguring containerized applications\\nBefore we go over how to pass configuration data to apps running in Kubernetes,\\nlet’s look at how containerized applications are usually configured.\\n If you skip the fact that you can bake the configuration into the application\\nitself, when starting development of a new app, you usually start off by having the\\nThis chapter covers\\n\\uf0a1Changing the main process of a container\\n\\uf0a1Passing command-line options to the app\\n\\uf0a1Setting environment variables exposed to the app\\n\\uf0a1Configuring apps through ConfigMaps\\n\\uf0a1Passing sensitive information through Secrets\\n \\n',\n",

Then, as the list of configuration\\noptions grows, you can move the configuration into a config file. \\n Another way of passing configuration options to an application that’s widely popu-\\nlar in containerized applications is through environment variables. Instead of having\\nthe app read a config file or command-line arguments, the app looks up the value of a\\ncertain environment variable. The official MySQL container image, for example, uses\\nan environment variable called MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD for setting the password for the\\nroot super-user account. \\n But why are environment variables so popular in containers? Using configuration\\nfiles inside Docker containers is a bit tricky, because you’d have to bake the config file\\ninto the container image itself or mount a volume containing the file into the con-\\ntainer. Obviously, baking files into the image is similar to hardcoding configuration\\ninto the source code of the application, because it requires you to rebuild the image\\nevery time you want to change the config. Plus, everyone with access to the image can\\nsee the config, including any information that should be kept secret, such as creden-\\ntials or encryption keys. Using a volume is better, but still requires you to make sure\\nthe file is written to the volume before the container is started. \\n If you’ve read the previous chapter, you might think of using a gitRepo volume as\\na configuration source. That’s not a bad idea, because it allows you to keep the config\\nnicely versioned and enables you to easily rollback a config change if necessary. But a\\nsimpler way allows you to put the configuration data into a top-level Kubernetes\\nresource and store it and all the other resource definitions in the same Git repository\\nor in any other file-based storage. The Kubernetes resource for storing configuration\\ndata is called a ConfigMap. We’ll learn how to use it in this chapter.\\n Regardless if you’re using a ConfigMap to store configuration data or not, you can\\nconfigure your apps by\\n\\uf0a1Passing command-line arguments to containers\\n\\uf0a1Setting custom environment variables for each container\\n\\uf0a1Mounting configuration files into containers through a special type of volume\\nWe’ll go over all these options in the next few sections, but before we start, let’s look\\nat config options from a security perspective. Though most configuration options\\ndon’t contain any sensitive information, several can. These include credentials, pri-\\nvate encryption keys, and similar data that needs to be kept secure. This type of infor-\\nmation needs to be handled with special care, which is why Kubernetes offers\\nanother type of first-class object called a Secret. We’ll learn about it in the last part of\\nthis chapter.\\n7.2\\nPassing command-line arguments to containers\\nIn all the examples so far, you’ve created containers that ran the default command\\ndefined in the container image, but Kubernetes allows overriding the command as\\npart of the pod’s container definition when you want to run a different executable\\n \\n',\n",

We’ll look at how to do that now.\\n7.2.1\\nDefining the command and arguments in Docker\\nThe first thing I need to explain is that the whole command that gets executed in the\\ncontainer is composed of two parts: the command and the arguments. \\nUNDERSTANDING ENTRYPOINT AND CMD\\nIn a Dockerfile, two instructions define the two parts:\\n\\uf0a1\\nENTRYPOINT defines the executable invoked when the container is started.\\n\\uf0a1\\nCMD specifies the arguments that get passed to the ENTRYPOINT.\\nAlthough you can use the CMD instruction to specify the command you want to execute\\nwhen the image is run, the correct way is to do it through the ENTRYPOINT instruction\\nand to only specify the CMD if you want to define the default arguments. The image can\\nthen be run without specifying any arguments\\n$ docker run <image>\\nor with additional arguments, which override whatever’s set under CMD in the Dockerfile:\\n$ docker run <image> <arguments>\\nUNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHELL AND EXEC FORMS\\nBut there’s more. Both instructions support two different forms:\\n\\uf0a1\\nshell form—For example, ENTRYPOINT node app.js.\\n\\uf0a1\\nexec form—For example, ENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"].\\nThe difference is whether the specified command is invoked inside a shell or not. \\n In the kubia image you created in chapter 2, you used the exec form of the ENTRY-\\nPOINT instruction: \\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\\nThis runs the node process directly (not inside a shell), as you can see by listing the\\nprocesses running inside the container:\\n$ docker exec 4675d ps x\\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\\n    1 ?        Ssl    0:00 node app.js\\n   12 ?        Rs     0:00 ps x\\nIf you’d used the shell form (ENTRYPOINT node app.js), these would have been the\\ncontainer’s processes:\\n$ docker exec -it e4bad ps x\\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\\n    1 ?

The shell process is unnecessary, which is why you should always use the exec\\nform of the ENTRYPOINT instruction.\\nMAKING THE INTERVAL CONFIGURABLE IN YOUR FORTUNE IMAGE\\nLet’s modify your fortune script and image so the delay interval in the loop is configu-\\nrable.

To start with the simplest exam-\\nple, you’ll first create a map with a single key and use it to fill the INTERVAL environment\\nvariable from your previous example. You’ll create the ConfigMap with the special\\nkubectl create configmap command instead of posting a YAML with the generic\\nkubectl create -f command. \\nUSING THE KUBECTL CREATE CONFIGMAP COMMAND\\nYou can define the map’s entries by passing literals to the kubectl command or you\\ncan create the ConfigMap from files stored on your disk. Use a simple literal first:\\n$ kubectl create configmap fortune-config --from-literal=sleep-interval=25\\nconfigmap \"fortune-config\" created\\nNOTE\\nConfigMap keys must be a valid DNS subdomain (they may only con-\\ntain alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and dots). They may\\noptionally include a leading dot.\\nThis creates a ConfigMap called fortune-config with the single-entry sleep-interval\\n=25 (figure 7.4).\\nConfigMaps usually contain more than one entry. To create a ConfigMap with multi-\\nple literal entries, you add multiple --from-literal arguments:\\n$ kubectl create configmap myconfigmap\\n➥  --from-literal=foo=bar --from-literal=bar=baz --from-literal=one=two\\nLet’s inspect the YAML descriptor of the ConfigMap you created by using the kubectl\\nget command, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get configmap fortune-config -o yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\ndata:\\n  sleep-interval: \"25\"                      \\nkind: ConfigMap                              \\nmetadata:\\n  creationTimestamp: 2016-08-11T20:31:08Z\\n  name: fortune-config                      \\n  namespace: default\\n  resourceVersion: \"910025\"\\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/default/configmaps/fortune-config\\n  uid: 88c4167e-6002-11e6-a50d-42010af00237\\nListing 7.8\\nA ConfigMap definition\\nsleep-interval\\n25\\nConﬁgMap: fortune-conﬁg\\nFigure 7.4\\nThe fortune-config \\nConfigMap containing a single entry\\nThe single entry \\nin this map\\nThis descriptor \\ndescribes a ConfigMap.\\nThe name of this map \\n(you’re referencing it \\nby this name)\\n \\n',\n",

As with literals,\\nyou can add multiple files by using the --from-file argument multiple times. \\nCREATING A CONFIGMAP FROM FILES IN A DIRECTORY\\nInstead of importing each file individually, you can even import all files from a file\\ndirectory:\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=/path/to/dir\\nIn this case, kubectl will create an individual map entry for each file in the specified\\ndirectory, but only for files whose name is a valid ConfigMap key. \\nCOMBINING DIFFERENT OPTIONS\\nWhen creating ConfigMaps, you can use a combination of all the options mentioned\\nhere (note that these files aren’t included in the book’s code archive—you can create\\nthem yourself if you’d like to try out the command):\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config  \\n➥  --from-file=foo.json                  \\n➥  --from-file=bar=foobar.conf              \\n➥  --from-file=config-opts/               \\n➥  --from-literal=some=thing    \\nHere, you’ve created the ConfigMap from multiple sources: a whole directory, a file,\\nanother file (but stored under a custom key instead of using the filename as the key),\\nand a literal value.

Luckily,\\nKubernetes version 1.6 provides a way to expose all entries of a ConfigMap as environ-\\nment variables. \\n Imagine having a ConfigMap with three keys called FOO, BAR, and FOO-BAR. You can\\nexpose them all as environment variables by using the envFrom attribute, instead of\\nenv the way you did in previous examples. The following listing shows an example.\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: some-image\\n    envFrom:                \\n    - prefix: CONFIG_             \\n      configMapRef:              \\n        name: my-config-map      \\n...\\nAs you can see, you can also specify a prefix for the environment variables (CONFIG_ in\\nthis case). This results in the following two environment variables being present inside\\nthe container: CONFIG_FOO and CONFIG_BAR. \\nNOTE\\nThe prefix is optional, so if you omit it the environment variables will\\nhave the same name as the keys. \\nDid you notice I said two variables, but earlier, I said the ConfigMap has three entries\\n(FOO, BAR, and FOO-BAR)? Why is there no environment variable for the FOO-BAR\\nConfigMap entry?\\n The reason is that CONFIG_FOO-BAR isn’t a valid environment variable name\\nbecause it contains a dash. Kubernetes doesn’t convert the keys in any way (it doesn’t\\nconvert dashes to underscores, for example). If a ConfigMap key isn’t in the proper\\nformat, it skips the entry (but it does record an event informing you it skipped it).\\n7.4.5\\nPassing a ConfigMap entry as a command-line argument\\nNow, let’s also look at how to pass values from a ConfigMap as arguments to the main\\nprocess running in the container.

If you run the pod from the previous listing, the\\n/etc/nginx/conf.d directory is kept nice and clean, because it only contains the\\ngzip.conf file and nothing else. \\nUNDERSTANDING THAT MOUNTING A DIRECTORY HIDES EXISTING FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY\\nThere’s one important thing to discuss at this point. In both this and in your previous\\nexample, you mounted the volume as a directory, which means you’ve hidden any files\\nthat are stored in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory in the container image itself. \\n This is generally what happens in Linux when you mount a filesystem into a non-\\nempty directory. The directory then only contains the files from the mounted filesys-\\ntem, whereas the original files in that directory are inaccessible for as long as the\\nfilesystem is mounted. \\n In your case, this has no terrible side effects, but imagine mounting a volume to\\nthe /etc directory, which usually contains many important files. This would most likely\\nbreak the whole container, because all of the original files that should be in the /etc\\ndirectory would no longer be there. If you need to add a file to a directory like /etc,\\nyou can’t use this method at all.\\nMOUNTING INDIVIDUAL CONFIGMAP ENTRIES AS FILES WITHOUT HIDING OTHER FILES IN THE DIRECTORY\\nNaturally, you’re now wondering how to add individual files from a ConfigMap into\\nan existing directory without hiding existing files stored in it. An additional subPath\\nproperty on the volumeMount allows you to mount either a single file or a single direc-\\ntory from the volume instead of mounting the whole volume. Perhaps this is easier to\\nexplain visually (see figure 7.10).\\n Say you have a configMap volume containing a myconfig.conf file, which you want\\nto add to the /etc directory as someconfig.conf. You can use the subPath property to\\nmount it there without affecting any other files in that directory. The relevant part of\\nthe pod definition is shown in the following listing.\\nPod\\nContainer\\nFilesystem\\n/\\netc/\\nsomeconﬁg.conf\\nexistingﬁle1\\nexistingﬁle2\\nConﬁgMap: app-conﬁg\\nmyconﬁg.conf\\nContents\\nof the ﬁle\\nanother-ﬁle\\nContents\\nof the ﬁle\\nconﬁgMap\\nvolume\\nmyconﬁg.conf\\nanother-ﬁle\\nexistingﬁle1\\nand existingﬁle2\\naren’t hidden.\\nOnly myconﬁg.conf is mounted\\ninto the container (yet under a\\ndifferent ﬁlename).\\nanother-ﬁle isn’t\\nmounted into the\\ncontainer.\\nFigure 7.10\\nMounting a single file from a volume\\n \\n',\n",

Instead of\\nmounting the whole volume, you can mount part of it. But this method of mounting\\nindividual files has a relatively big deficiency related to updating files. You’ll learn\\nmore about this in the following section, but first, let’s finish talking about the initial\\nstate of a configMap volume by saying a few words about file permissions.\\nSETTING THE FILE PERMISSIONS FOR FILES IN A CONFIGMAP VOLUME\\nBy default, the permissions on all files in a configMap volume are set to 644 (-rw-r—r--).\\nYou can change this by setting the defaultMode property in the volume spec, as shown\\nin the following listing.\\n  volumes:\\n  - name: config\\n    configMap:\\n      name: fortune-config\\n      defaultMode: \"6600\"       \\nAlthough ConfigMaps should be used for non-sensitive configuration data, you may\\nwant to make the file readable and writable only to the user and group the file is\\nowned by, as the example in the previous listing shows. \\n7.4.7\\nUpdating an app’s config without having to restart the app\\nWe’ve said that one of the drawbacks of using environment variables or command-line\\narguments as a configuration source is the inability to update them while the pro-\\ncess is running. Using a ConfigMap and exposing it through a volume brings the\\nability to update the configuration without having to recreate the pod or even restart\\nthe container. \\n When you update a ConfigMap, the files in all the volumes referencing it are\\nupdated. It’s then up to the process to detect that they’ve been changed and reload\\nthem. But Kubernetes will most likely eventually also support sending a signal to the\\ncontainer after updating the files.\\nWARNING\\nBe aware that as I’m writing this, it takes a surprisingly long time\\nfor the files to be updated after you update the ConfigMap (it can take up to\\none whole minute).\\nListing 7.17\\nA pod with a specific config map entry mounted into a specific file\\nListing 7.18\\nSetting file permissions: fortune-pod-configmap-volume-defaultMode.yaml \\nYou’re mounting into \\na file, not a directory.\\nInstead of mounting the whole \\nvolume, you’re only mounting \\nthe myconfig.conf entry.\\nThis sets the permissions \\nfor all files to -rw-rw------.\\n \\n',\n",

You’ll modify the Nginx config file\\nfrom your previous example and make Nginx use the new config without restarting\\nthe pod. Try switching gzip compression off by editing the fortune-config Config-\\nMap with kubectl edit:\\n$ kubectl edit configmap fortune-config\\nOnce your editor opens, change the gzip on line to gzip off, save the file, and then\\nclose the editor. The ConfigMap is then updated, and soon afterward, the actual file\\nin the volume is updated as well. You can confirm this by printing the contents of the\\nfile with kubectl exec:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server\\n➥  cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-nginx-config.conf\\nIf you don’t see the update yet, wait a while and try again. It takes a while for the\\nfiles to get updated. Eventually, you’ll see the change in the config file, but you’ll\\nfind this has no effect on Nginx, because it doesn’t watch the files and reload them\\nautomatically. \\nSIGNALING NGINX TO RELOAD THE CONFIG\\nNginx will continue to compress its responses until you tell it to reload its config files,\\nwhich you can do with the following command:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server -- nginx -s reload\\nNow, if you try hitting the server again with curl, you should see the response is no\\nlonger compressed (it no longer contains the Content-Encoding: gzip header).\\nYou’ve effectively changed the app’s config without having to restart the container or\\nrecreate the pod. \\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE FILES ARE UPDATED ATOMICALLY\\nYou may wonder what happens if an app can detect config file changes on its own and\\nreloads them before Kubernetes has finished updating all the files in the configMap\\nvolume. Luckily, this can’t happen, because all the files are updated atomically, which\\nmeans all updates occur at once. Kubernetes achieves this by using symbolic links. If\\nyou list all the files in the mounted configMap volume, you’ll see something like the\\nfollowing listing.\\n$ kubectl exec -it fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server -- ls -lA \\n➥  /etc/nginx/conf.d\\ntotal 4\\ndrwxr-xr-x  ... 12:15 ..4984_09_04_12_15_06.865837643\\nListing 7.19\\nFiles in a mounted configMap volume\\n \\n',\n",

The ..data dir is also a symbolic link pointing to a direc-\\ntory called ..4984_09_04_something. When the ConfigMap is updated, Kubernetes\\ncreates a new directory like this, writes all the files to it, and then re-links the ..data\\nsymbolic link to the new directory, effectively changing all files at once.\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT FILES MOUNTED INTO EXISTING DIRECTORIES DON’T GET UPDATED\\nOne big caveat relates to updating ConfigMap-backed volumes. If you’ve mounted a\\nsingle file in the container instead of the whole volume, the file will not be updated!\\nAt least, this is true at the time of writing this chapter. \\n For now, if you need to add an individual file and have it updated when you update\\nits source ConfigMap, one workaround is to mount the whole volume into a different\\ndirectory and then create a symbolic link pointing to the file in question. The sym-\\nlink can either be created in the container image itself, or you could create the\\nsymlink when the container starts.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF UPDATING A CONFIGMAP\\nOne of the most important features of containers is their immutability, which allows\\nus to be certain that no differences exist between multiple running containers created\\nfrom the same image, so is it wrong to bypass this immutability by modifying a Config-\\nMap used by running containers? \\n The main problem occurs when the app doesn’t support reloading its configura-\\ntion. This results in different running instances being configured differently—those\\npods that are created after the ConfigMap is changed will use the new config, whereas\\nthe old pods will still use the old one. And this isn’t limited to new pods. If a pod’s con-\\ntainer is restarted (for whatever reason), the new process will also see the new config.\\nTherefore, if the app doesn’t reload its config automatically, modifying an existing\\nConfigMap (while pods are using it) may not be a good idea. \\n If the app does support reloading, modifying the ConfigMap usually isn’t such a\\nbig deal, but you do need to be aware that because files in the ConfigMap volumes\\naren’t updated synchronously across all running instances, the files in individual pods\\nmay be out of sync for up to a whole minute.\\n7.5\\nUsing Secrets to pass sensitive data to containers\\nAll the information you’ve passed to your containers so far is regular, non-sensitive\\nconfiguration data that doesn’t need to be kept secure. But as we mentioned at the\\nstart of the chapter, the config usually also includes sensitive information, such as cre-\\ndentials and private encryption keys, which need to be kept secure.\\n \\n',\n",

Secrets are much like ConfigMaps—they’re also maps that hold key-value\\npairs. They can be used the same way as a ConfigMap. You can\\n\\uf0a1Pass Secret entries to the container as environment variables\\n\\uf0a1Expose Secret entries as files in a volume\\nKubernetes helps keep your Secrets safe by making sure each Secret is only distributed\\nto the nodes that run the pods that need access to the Secret. Also, on the nodes\\nthemselves, Secrets are always stored in memory and never written to physical storage,\\nwhich would require wiping the disks after deleting the Secrets from them. \\n On the master node itself (more specifically in etcd), Secrets used to be stored in\\nunencrypted form, which meant the master node needs to be secured to keep the sensi-\\ntive data stored in Secrets secure. This didn’t only include keeping the etcd storage\\nsecure, but also preventing unauthorized users from using the API server, because any-\\none who can create pods can mount the Secret into the pod and gain access to the sen-\\nsitive data through it. From Kubernetes version 1.7, etcd stores Secrets in encrypted\\nform, making the system much more secure. Because of this, it’s imperative you prop-\\nerly choose when to use a Secret or a ConfigMap. Choosing between them is simple:\\n\\uf0a1Use a ConfigMap to store non-sensitive, plain configuration data.\\n\\uf0a1Use a Secret to store any data that is sensitive in nature and needs to be kept\\nunder key. If a config file includes both sensitive and not-sensitive data, you\\nshould store the file in a Secret.\\nYou already used Secrets in chapter 5, when you created a Secret to hold the TLS certifi-\\ncate needed for the Ingress resource. Now you’ll explore Secrets in more detail.\\n7.5.2\\nIntroducing the default token Secret\\nYou’ll start learning about Secrets by examining a Secret that’s mounted into every\\ncontainer you run. You may have noticed it when using kubectl describe on a pod.\\nThe command’s output has always contained something like this:\\nVolumes:\\n  default-token-cfee9:\\n    Type:       Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)\\n    SecretName: default-token-cfee9\\nEvery pod has a secret volume attached to it automatically. The volume in the previ-\\nous kubectl describe output refers to a Secret called default-token-cfee9. Because\\nSecrets are resources, you can list them with kubectl get secrets and find the\\ndefault-token Secret in that list. Let’s see:\\n$ kubectl get secrets\\nNAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE\\ndefault-token-cfee9   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3         39d\\n \\n',\n",

You can check the\\nserver’s certificate to see if it matches the one you generated earlier. This can also be\\ndone with curl by turning on verbose logging using the -v option, as shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\n$ curl https://localhost:8443 -k -v\\n* About to connect() to localhost port 8443 (#0)\\n*   Trying ::1...\\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8443 (#0)\\n* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb\\n* skipping SSL peer certificate verification\\n* SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\\n* Server certificate:\\n*   subject: CN=www.kubia-example.com          \\n*   start date: aug 16 18:43:13 2016 GMT       \\n*   expire date: aug 14 18:43:13 2026 GMT      \\n*   common name: www.kubia-example.com         \\n*   issuer: CN=www.kubia-example.com           \\nUNDERSTANDING SECRET VOLUMES ARE STORED IN MEMORY\\nYou successfully delivered your certificate and private key to your container by mount-\\ning a secret volume in its directory tree at /etc/nginx/certs. The secret volume uses\\nan in-memory filesystem (tmpfs) for the Secret files. You can see this if you list mounts\\nin the container:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-https -c web-server -- mount | grep certs\\ntmpfs on /etc/nginx/certs type tmpfs (ro,relatime) \\nBecause tmpfs is used, the sensitive data stored in the Secret is never written to disk,\\nwhere it could be compromised. \\nEXPOSING A SECRET’S ENTRIES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\\nInstead of using a volume, you could also have exposed individual entries from the\\nsecret as environment variables, the way you did with the sleep-interval entry from\\nthe ConfigMap. For example, if you wanted to expose the foo key from your Secret as\\nenvironment variable FOO_SECRET, you’d add the snippet from the following listing to\\nthe container definition.\\nListing 7.26\\nDisplaying the server certificate sent by Nginx\\nThe certificate \\nmatches the one you \\ncreated and stored \\nin the Secret.\\n \\n',\n",

Applications usually dump envi-\\nronment variables in error reports or even write them to the application log at startup,\\nwhich may unintentionally expose them. Additionally, child processes inherit all the\\nenvironment variables of the parent process, so if your app runs a third-party binary,\\nyou have no way of knowing what happens with your secret data. \\nTIP\\nThink twice before using environment variables to pass your Secrets to\\nyour container, because they may get exposed inadvertently. To be safe, always\\nuse secret volumes for exposing Secrets.\\n7.5.6\\nUnderstanding image pull Secrets\\nYou’ve learned how to pass Secrets to your applications and use the data they contain.\\nBut sometimes Kubernetes itself requires you to pass credentials to it—for example,\\nwhen you’d like to use images from a private container image registry. This is also\\ndone through Secrets.\\n Up to now all your container images have been stored on public image registries,\\nwhich don’t require any special credentials to pull images from them. But most orga-\\nnizations don’t want their images to be available to everyone and thus use a private\\nimage registry. When deploying a pod, whose container images reside in a private reg-\\nistry, Kubernetes needs to know the credentials required to pull the image. Let’s see\\nhow to do that.\\nUSING A PRIVATE IMAGE REPOSITORY ON DOCKER HUB\\nDocker Hub, in addition to public image repositories, also allows you to create private\\nrepositories. You can mark a repository as private by logging in at http:/\\n/hub.docker\\n.com with your web browser, finding the repository and checking a checkbox. \\n To run a pod, which uses an image from the private repository, you need to do\\ntwo things:\\n\\uf0a1Create a Secret holding the credentials for the Docker registry.\\n\\uf0a1Reference that Secret in the imagePullSecrets field of the pod manifest.\\nListing 7.27\\nExposing a Secret’s entry as an environment variable\\nThe variable should be set \\nfrom the entry of a Secret.\\nThe name of the Secret \\nholding the key\\nThe key of the Secret \\nto expose\\n \\n',\n",

You\\nuse the same kubectl create secret command, but with a different type and\\noptions:\\n$ kubectl create secret docker-registry mydockerhubsecret \\\\\\n  --docker-username=myusername --docker-password=mypassword \\\\ \\n  --docker-email=my.email@provider.com\\nRather than create a generic secret, you’re creating a docker-registry Secret called\\nmydockerhubsecret. You’re specifying your Docker Hub username, password, and\\nemail. If you inspect the contents of the newly created Secret with kubectl describe,\\nyou’ll see that it includes a single entry called .dockercfg. This is equivalent to the\\n.dockercfg file in your home directory, which is created by Docker when you run the\\ndocker login command.\\nUSING THE DOCKER-REGISTRY SECRET IN A POD DEFINITION\\nTo have Kubernetes use the Secret when pulling images from your private Docker\\nHub repository, all you need to do is specify the Secret’s name in the pod spec, as\\nshown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: private-pod\\nspec:\\n  imagePullSecrets:                 \\n  - name: mydockerhubsecret         \\n  containers:\\n  - image: username/private:tag\\n    name: main\\nIn the pod definition in the previous listing, you’re specifying the mydockerhubsecret\\nSecret as one of the imagePullSecrets.

But what about data that isn’t known up until\\nthat point—such as the pod’s IP, the host node’s name, or even the pod’s own name\\n(when the name is generated; for example, when the pod is created by a ReplicaSet\\nor similar controller)? And what about data that’s already specified elsewhere, such\\nas a pod’s labels and annotations? You don’t want to repeat the same information in\\nmultiple places.\\n Both these problems are solved by the Kubernetes Downward API. It allows you to\\npass metadata about the pod and its environment through environment variables or\\nfiles (in a downwardAPI volume). Don’t be confused by the name. The Downward API\\nisn’t like a REST endpoint that your app needs to hit so it can get the data. It’s a way of\\nhaving environment variables or files populated with values from the pod’s specifica-\\ntion or status, as shown in figure 8.1.\\n8.1.1\\nUnderstanding the available metadata\\nThe Downward API enables you to expose the pod’s own metadata to the processes\\nrunning inside that pod. Currently, it allows you to pass the following information to\\nyour containers:\\n\\uf0a1The pod’s name\\n\\uf0a1The pod’s IP address\\nContainer: main\\nEnvironment\\nvariables\\nAPI server\\nUsed to initialize environment\\nvariables and ﬁles in the\\ndownwardAPI volume\\nPod manifest\\n- Metadata\\n- Status\\nPod\\ndownwardAPI\\nvolume\\nApp process\\nFigure 8.1\\nThe Downward API exposes pod metadata through environment variables or files.\\n \\n',\n",

When exposing con-\\ntainer-level metadata, such as a container’s resource limit or requests (done using\\nresourceFieldRef), you need to specify the name of the container whose resource\\nfield you’re referencing, as shown in the following listing.\\nspec:\\n  volumes:\\n  - name: downward                       \\n    downwardAPI:                         \\n      items:\\n      - path: \"containerCpuRequestMilliCores\"\\n        resourceFieldRef:\\n          containerName: main       \\n          resource: requests.cpu\\n          divisor: 1m\\nThe reason for this becomes obvious if you consider that volumes are defined at the\\npod level, not at the container level. When referring to a container’s resource field\\ninside a volume specification, you need to explicitly specify the name of the container\\nyou’re referring to. This is true even for single-container pods. \\n Using volumes to expose a container’s resource requests and/or limits is slightly\\nmore complicated than using environment variables, but the benefit is that it allows\\nyou to pass one container’s resource fields to a different container if needed (but\\nboth containers need to be in the same pod). With environment variables, a container\\ncan only be passed its own resource limits and requests. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHEN TO USE THE DOWNWARD API\\nAs you’ve seen, using the Downward API isn’t complicated. It allows you to keep the\\napplication Kubernetes-agnostic. This is especially useful when you’re dealing with an\\nexisting application that expects certain data in environment variables. The Down-\\nward API allows you to expose the data to the application without having to rewrite\\nthe application or wrap it in a shell script, which collects the data and then exposes it\\nthrough environment variables.\\n But the metadata available through the Downward API is fairly limited. If you need\\nmore, you’ll need to obtain it from the Kubernetes API server directly. You’ll learn\\nhow to do that next.\\n8.2\\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\\nWe’ve seen how the Downward API provides a simple way to pass certain pod and con-\\ntainer metadata to the process running inside them. It only exposes the pod’s own\\nmetadata and a subset of all of the pod’s data. But sometimes your app will need to\\nknow more about other pods and even other resources defined in your cluster. The\\nDownward API doesn’t help in those cases.\\nListing 8.6\\nReferring to container-level metadata in a downwardAPI volume\\nContainer name \\nmust be specified\\n \\n',\n",

But\\nwhen the app needs data about other resources or when it requires access to the most\\nup-to-date information as possible, it needs to talk to the API server directly (as shown\\nin figure 8.4).\\nBefore you see how apps within pods can talk to the Kubernetes API server, let’s first\\nexplore the server’s REST endpoints from your local machine, so you can see what\\ntalking to the API server looks like.\\n8.2.1\\nExploring the Kubernetes REST API\\nYou’ve learned about different Kubernetes resource types. But if you’re planning on\\ndeveloping apps that talk to the Kubernetes API, you’ll want to know the API first. \\n To do that, you can try hitting the API server directly. You can get its URL by run-\\nning kubectl cluster-info:\\n$ kubectl cluster-info\\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443\\nBecause the server uses HTTPS and requires authentication, it’s not simple to talk to\\nit directly. You can try accessing it with curl and using curl’s --insecure (or -k)\\noption to skip the server certificate check, but that doesn’t get you far:\\n$ curl https://192.168.99.100:8443 -k\\nUnauthorized\\nLuckily, rather than dealing with authentication yourself, you can talk to the server\\nthrough a proxy by running the kubectl proxy command. \\nACCESSING THE API SERVER THROUGH KUBECTL PROXY \\nThe kubectl proxy command runs a proxy server that accepts HTTP connections on\\nyour local machine and proxies them to the API server while taking care of authenti-\\ncation, so you don’t need to pass the authentication token in every request. It also\\nmakes sure you’re talking to the actual API server and not a man in the middle (by\\nverifying the server’s certificate on each request).\\nContainer\\nAPI server\\nPod\\nApp process\\nAPI objects\\nFigure 8.4\\nTalking to the API server \\nfrom inside a pod to get information \\nabout other API objects\\n \\n',\n",

The \"verbs\" array says you can retrieve, update, and delete Job resources\\nthrough that endpoint. For certain resources, additional API endpoints are also\\nexposed (such as the jobs/status path, which allows modifying only the status of\\na Job).\\nLISTING ALL JOB INSTANCES IN THE CLUSTER\\nTo get a list of Jobs in your cluster, perform a GET request on path /apis/batch/\\nv1/jobs, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ curl http://localhost:8001/apis/batch/v1/jobs\\n{\\n  \"kind\": \"JobList\",\\n  \"apiVersion\": \"batch/v1\",\\n  \"metadata\": {\\n    \"selfLink\": \"/apis/batch/v1/jobs\",\\n    \"resourceVersion\": \"225162\"\\n  },\\nListing 8.10\\nList of Jobs: http:/\\n/localhost:8001/apis/batch/v1/jobs\\nHere are the verbs that can be used \\nwith this resource (you can create \\nJobs; delete individual ones or a \\ncollection of them; and retrieve, \\nwatch, and update them).\\nResources also have a \\nspecial REST endpoint for \\nmodifying their status.\\nThe status can be \\nretrieved, patched, \\nor updated.\\n \\n',\n",

Now, let’s see how to talk to it from within a pod, where you (usually)\\ndon’t have kubectl. Therefore, to talk to the API server from inside a pod, you need\\nto take care of three things:\\n\\uf0a1Find the location of the API server.\\n\\uf0a1Make sure you’re talking to the API server and not something impersonating it.\\n\\uf0a1Authenticate with the server; otherwise it won’t let you see or do anything.\\nListing 8.11\\nRetrieving a resource in a specific namespace by name\\n \\n',\n",

You’ll run a pod\\nthat does nothing (it runs the sleep command in its only container), and then run a\\nshell in the container with kubectl exec. Then you’ll try to access the API server from\\nwithin that shell using curl.\\n Therefore, you need to use a container image that contains the curl binary. If you\\nsearch for such an image on, say, Docker Hub, you’ll find the tutum/curl image, so\\nuse it (you can also use any other existing image containing the curl binary or you\\ncan build your own). The pod definition is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: curl\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: tutum/curl                \\n    command: [\"sleep\", \"9999999\"]    \\nAfter creating the pod, run kubectl exec to run a bash shell inside its container:\\n$ kubectl exec -it curl bash\\nroot@curl:/#\\nYou’re now ready to talk to the API server.\\nFINDING THE API SERVER’S ADDRESS\\nFirst, you need to find the IP and port of the Kubernetes API server. This is easy,\\nbecause a Service called kubernetes is automatically exposed in the default name-\\nspace and configured to point to the API server. You may remember seeing it every\\ntime you listed services with kubectl get svc:\\n$ kubectl get svc\\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\\nkubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   46d\\nAnd you’ll remember from chapter 5 that environment variables are configured for\\neach service. You can get both the IP address and the port of the API server by looking\\nup the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT variables (inside\\nthe container):\\nroot@curl:/# env | grep KUBERNETES_SERVICE\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.1\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443\\nListing 8.12\\nA pod for trying out communication with the API server: curl.yaml\\nUsing the tutum/curl image, \\nbecause you need curl \\navailable in the container\\nYou’re running the sleep \\ncommand with a long delay to \\nkeep your container running.\\n \\n',\n",

To be fair, if you don’t know which port the service is available at,\\nyou also either need to look up the environment variables or perform a DNS SRV\\nrecord lookup to get the service’s actual port number. \\n The environment variables shown previously say that the API server is listening on\\nport 443, which is the default port for HTTPS, so try hitting the server through\\nHTTPS:\\nroot@curl:/# curl https://kubernetes\\ncurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n...\\nIf you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use\\n  the -k (or --insecure) option.\\nAlthough the simplest way to get around this is to use the proposed -k option (and\\nthis is what you’d normally use when playing with the API server manually), let’s look\\nat the longer (and correct) route. Instead of blindly trusting that the server you’re\\nconnecting to is the authentic API server, you’ll verify its identity by having curl check\\nits certificate. \\nTIP\\nNever skip checking the server’s certificate in an actual application.\\nDoing so could make your app expose its authentication token to an attacker\\nusing a man-in-the-middle attack.\\nVERIFYING THE SERVER’S IDENTITY\\nIn the previous chapter, while discussing Secrets, we looked at an automatically cre-\\nated Secret called default-token-xyz, which is mounted into each container at\\n/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. Let’s see the contents of that Secret\\nagain, by listing files in that directory:\\nroot@curl:/# \\nls \\n/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nca.crt    namespace    token\\nThe Secret has three entries (and therefore three files in the Secret volume). Right\\nnow, we’ll focus on the ca.crt file, which holds the certificate of the certificate author-\\nity (CA) used to sign the Kubernetes API server’s certificate. To verify you’re talking to\\nthe API server, you need to check if the server’s certificate is signed by the CA. curl\\nallows you to specify the CA certificate with the --cacert option, so try hitting the API\\nserver again:\\nroot@curl:/# curl --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount\\n             ➥ /ca.crt https://kubernetes\\nUnauthorized\\nNOTE\\nYou may see a longer error description than “Unauthorized.”\\n \\n\",\n",

As the Unauthorized response suggests, you still need\\nto take care of authentication. You’ll do that in a moment, but first let’s see how to\\nmake life easier by setting the CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable, so you don’t\\nneed to specify --cacert every time you run curl:\\nroot@curl:/# export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/\\n             ➥ serviceaccount/ca.crt\\nYou can now hit the API server without using --cacert:\\nroot@curl:/# curl https://kubernetes\\nUnauthorized\\nThis is much nicer now. Your client (curl) trusts the API server now, but the API\\nserver itself says you’re not authorized to access it, because it doesn’t know who\\nyou are.\\nAUTHENTICATING WITH THE API SERVER\\nYou need to authenticate with the server, so it allows you to read and even update\\nand/or delete the API objects deployed in the cluster. To authenticate, you need an\\nauthentication token. Luckily, the token is provided through the default-token Secret\\nmentioned previously, and is stored in the token file in the secret volume. As the\\nSecret’s name suggests, that’s the primary purpose of the Secret. \\n You’re going to use the token to access the API server. First, load the token into an\\nenvironment variable:\\nroot@curl:/# TOKEN=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/\\n             ➥ serviceaccount/token)\\nThe token is now stored in the TOKEN environment variable. You can use it when send-\\ning requests to the API server, as shown in the following listing.\\nroot@curl:/# curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" https://kubernetes\\n{\\n  \"paths\": [\\n    \"/api\",\\n    \"/api/v1\",\\n    \"/apis\",\\n    \"/apis/apps\",\\n    \"/apis/apps/v1beta1\",\\n    \"/apis/authorization.k8s.io\",    \\n    ...\\n    \"/ui/\",\\n    \"/version\"\\n  ]\\n}\\nListing 8.13\\nGetting a proper response from the API server\\n \\n',\n",

The API server recognized the token as authentic and returned a proper\\nresponse. You can now explore all the resources in your cluster, the way you did a few\\nsections ago. \\n For example, you could list all the pods in the same namespace. But first you need\\nto know what namespace the curl pod is running in.\\nGETTING THE NAMESPACE THE POD IS RUNNING IN\\nIn the first part of this chapter, you saw how to pass the namespace to the pod\\nthrough the Downward API. But if you’re paying attention, you probably noticed\\nyour secret volume also contains a file called namespace. It contains the name-\\nspace the pod is running in, so you can read the file instead of having to explicitly\\npass the namespace to your pod through an environment variable. Load the con-\\ntents of the file into the NS environment variable and then list all the pods, as shown\\nin the following listing.\\nroot@curl:/# NS=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/\\n             ➥ serviceaccount/namespace)           \\nroot@curl:/# curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\"\\n             ➥ https://kubernetes/api/v1/namespaces/$NS/pods\\n{\\n  \"kind\": \"PodList\",\\n  \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\\n  ...\\nAnd there you go. By using the three files in the mounted secret volume directory,\\nyou listed all the pods running in the same namespace as your pod. In the same man-\\nner, you could also retrieve other API objects and even update them by sending PUT or\\nPATCH instead of simple GET requests. \\nDisabling role-based access control (RBAC)\\nIf you’re using a Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled, the service account may not\\nbe authorized to access (parts of) the API server. You’ll learn about service accounts\\nand RBAC in chapter 12. For now, the simplest way to allow you to query the API\\nserver is to work around RBAC by running the following command:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding permissive-binding \\\\\\n  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \\\\\\n  --group=system:serviceaccounts\\nThis gives all service accounts (we could also say all pods) cluster-admin privileges,\\nallowing them to do whatever they want. Obviously, doing this is dangerous and\\nshould never be done on production clusters. For test purposes, it’s fine.\\nListing 8.14\\nListing pods in the pod’s own namespace\\n \\n',\n",

You ran\\nthe command on your local machine to make it easier to access the API server. Instead\\nof sending requests to the API server directly, you sent them to the proxy and let it\\ntake care of authentication, encryption, and server verification. The same method can\\nbe used inside your pods, as well.\\nINTRODUCING THE AMBASSADOR CONTAINER PATTERN\\nImagine having an application that (among other things) needs to query the API\\nserver. Instead of it talking to the API server directly, as you did in the previous sec-\\ntion, you can run kubectl proxy in an ambassador container alongside the main con-\\ntainer and communicate with the API server through it. \\n Instead of talking to the API server directly, the app in the main container can con-\\nnect to the ambassador through HTTP (instead of HTTPS) and let the ambassador\\nproxy handle the HTTPS connection to the API server, taking care of security trans-\\nparently (see figure 8.6). It does this by using the files from the default token’s secret\\nvolume.\\nBecause all containers in a pod share the same loopback network interface, your app\\ncan access the proxy through a port on localhost.\\nRUNNING THE CURL POD WITH AN ADDITIONAL AMBASSADOR CONTAINER\\nTo see the ambassador container pattern in action, you’ll create a new pod like the\\ncurl pod you created earlier, but this time, instead of running a single container in\\nthe pod, you’ll run an additional ambassador container based on a general-purpose\\nkubectl-proxy container image I’ve created and pushed to Docker Hub. You’ll find\\nthe Dockerfile for the image in the code archive (in /Chapter08/kubectl-proxy/) if\\nyou want to build it yourself.\\n The pod’s manifest is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: curl-with-ambassador\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\nListing 8.15\\nA pod with an ambassador container: curl-with-ambassador.yaml\\nContainer:\\nmain\\nContainer:\\nambassador\\nHTTP\\nHTTPS\\nAPI server\\nPod\\nFigure 8.6\\nUsing an ambassador to connect to the API server\\n \\n',\n",

But if you want to run a com-\\nmand inside any other container, you do need to specify the container’s name using\\nthe -c option.\\nTALKING TO THE API SERVER THROUGH THE AMBASSADOR\\nNext you’ll try connecting to the API server through the ambassador container. By\\ndefault, kubectl proxy binds to port 8001, and because both containers in the pod\\nshare the same network interfaces, including loopback, you can point curl to local-\\nhost:8001, as shown in the following listing.\\nroot@curl-with-ambassador:/# curl localhost:8001\\n{\\n  \"paths\": [\\n    \"/api\",\\n    ...\\n  ]\\n}\\nSuccess! The output printed by curl is the same response you saw earlier, but this time\\nyou didn’t need to deal with authentication tokens and server certificates. \\n To get a clear picture of what exactly happened, refer to figure 8.7. curl sent the\\nplain HTTP request (without any authentication headers) to the proxy running inside\\nthe ambassador container, and then the proxy sent an HTTPS request to the API\\nserver, handling the client authentication by sending the token and checking the\\nserver’s identity by validating its certificate.\\n This is a great example of how an ambassador container can be used to hide the\\ncomplexities of connecting to an external service and simplify the app running in\\nthe main container. The ambassador container is reusable across many different apps,\\nregardless of what language the main app is written in. The downside is that an addi-\\ntional process is running and consuming additional resources.\\nListing 8.16\\nAccessing the API server through the ambassador container\\nThe ambassador container, \\nrunning the kubectl-proxy image\\n \\n',\n",

Swagger, which I mentioned in the\\nprevious section, is not just a tool for specifying an API, but also provides a web UI for\\nexploring REST APIs if they expose the Swagger API definitions. The better way of\\nexploring REST APIs is through this UI.\\n Kubernetes not only exposes the Swagger API, but it also has Swagger UI inte-\\ngrated into the API server, though it’s not enabled by default. You can enable it by\\nrunning the API server with the --enable-swagger-ui=true option.\\nTIP\\nIf you’re using Minikube, you can enable Swagger UI when starting the\\ncluster: minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.Features.Enable-\\nSwaggerUI=true\\nAfter you enable the UI, you can open it in your browser by pointing it to:\\nhttp(s)://<api server>:<port>/swagger-ui\\nI urge you to give Swagger UI a try. It not only allows you to browse the Kubernetes\\nAPI, but also interact with it (you can POST JSON resource manifests, PATCH resources,\\nor DELETE them, for example). \\n \\n',\n",

If\\nyou’re not completely sure what that means, keep reading—it’s not as complicated as\\nit sounds.\\n9.1\\nUpdating applications running in pods\\nLet’s start off with a simple example. Imagine having a set of pod instances providing a\\nservice to other pods and/or external clients. After reading this book up to this point,\\nyou likely recognize that these pods are backed by a ReplicationController or a\\nReplicaSet. A Service also exists through which clients (apps running in other pods or\\nexternal clients) access the pods. This is how a basic application looks in Kubernetes\\n(shown in figure 9.1).\\nInitially, the pods run the first version of your application—let’s suppose its image is\\ntagged as v1. You then develop a newer version of the app and push it to an image\\nrepository as a new image, tagged as v2. You’d next like to replace all the pods with\\nthis new version. Because you can’t change an existing pod’s image after the pod is\\ncreated, you need to remove the old pods and replace them with new ones running\\nthe new image. \\n You have two ways of updating all those pods. You can do one of the following:\\n\\uf0a1Delete all existing pods first and then start the new ones.\\n\\uf0a1Start new ones and, once they’re up, delete the old ones. You can do this either\\nby adding all the new pods and then deleting all the old ones at once, or\\nsequentially, by adding new pods and removing old ones gradually.\\nBoth these strategies have their benefits and drawbacks. The first option would lead to\\na short period of time when your application is unavailable. The second option\\nrequires your app to handle running two versions of the app at the same time. If your\\napp stores data in a data store, the new version shouldn’t modify the data schema or\\nthe data in such a way that breaks the previous version.\\nReplicationController\\nor ReplicaSet\\nClients\\nService\\nPod\\nPod\\nPod\\nFigure 9.1\\nThe basic outline of an \\napplication running in Kubernetes\\n \\n',\n",

First, let’s look at\\nhow to do this manually; then, once you know what’s involved in the process, you’ll\\nlearn how to have Kubernetes perform the update automatically.\\n9.1.1\\nDeleting old pods and replacing them with new ones\\nYou already know how to get a ReplicationController to replace all its pod instances\\nwith pods running a new version. You probably remember the pod template of a\\nReplicationController can be updated at any time. When the ReplicationController\\ncreates new instances, it uses the updated pod template to create them.\\n If you have a ReplicationController managing a set of v1 pods, you can easily\\nreplace them by modifying the pod template so it refers to version v2 of the image and\\nthen deleting the old pod instances. The ReplicationController will notice that no\\npods match its label selector and it will spin up new instances. The whole process is\\nshown in figure 9.2.\\nThis is the simplest way to update a set of pods, if you can accept the short downtime\\nbetween the time the old pods are deleted and new ones are started.\\n9.1.2\\nSpinning up new pods and then deleting the old ones\\nIf you don’t want to see any downtime and your app supports running multiple ver-\\nsions at once, you can turn the process around and first spin up all the new pods and\\nPod template\\nchanged\\nv pods deleted\\n1\\nmanually\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nReplicationController\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nPod: v1\\nService\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v2\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v1\\nPod: v1\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nShort period of\\ndowntime here\\nv2 pods created by\\nReplicationController\\nFigure 9.2\\nUpdating pods by changing a ReplicationController’s pod template and deleting old Pods\\n \\n',\n",

This will require more hardware resources, because\\nyou’ll have double the number of pods running at the same time for a short while. \\n This is a slightly more complex method compared to the previous one, but you\\nshould be able to do it by combining what you’ve learned about ReplicationControl-\\nlers and Services so far.\\nSWITCHING FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW VERSION AT ONCE\\nPods are usually fronted by a Service. It’s possible to have the Service front only the\\ninitial version of the pods while you bring up the pods running the new version. Then,\\nonce all the new pods are up, you can change the Service’s label selector and have the\\nService switch over to the new pods, as shown in figure 9.3. This is called a blue-green\\ndeployment. After switching over, and once you’re sure the new version functions cor-\\nrectly, you’re free to delete the old pods by deleting the old ReplicationController.\\nNOTE\\nYou can change a Service’s pod selector with the kubectl set selec-\\ntor command.\\nPERFORMING A ROLLING UPDATE\\nInstead of bringing up all the new pods and deleting the old pods at once, you can\\nalso perform a rolling update, which replaces pods step by step. You do this by slowly\\nscaling down the previous ReplicationController and scaling up the new one. In this\\ncase, you’ll want the Service’s pod selector to include both the old and the new pods,\\nso it directs requests toward both sets of pods. See figure 9.4.\\n Doing a rolling update manually is laborious and error-prone. Depending on the\\nnumber of replicas, you’d need to run a dozen or more commands in the proper\\norder to perform the update process. Luckily, Kubernetes allows you to perform the\\nrolling update with a single command.

Using kubectl to perform the update makes the process\\nmuch easier, but, as you’ll see later, this is now an outdated way of updating apps. Nev-\\nertheless, we’ll walk through this option first, because it was historically the first way of\\ndoing an automatic rolling update, and also allows us to discuss the process without\\nintroducing too many additional concepts. \\n9.2.1\\nRunning the initial version of the app\\nObviously, before you can update an app, you need to have an app deployed. You’re\\ngoing to use a slightly modified version of the kubia NodeJS app you created in chap-\\nter 2 as your initial version. In case you don’t remember what it does, it’s a simple web-\\napp that returns the pod’s hostname in the HTTP response. \\nCREATING THE V1 APP\\nYou’ll change the app so it also returns its version number in the response, which will\\nallow you to distinguish between the different versions you’re about to build.

The rolling-update pro-\\ncess has modified the selector of the first ReplicationController, as well:\\n$ kubectl describe rc kubia-v1\\nName:       kubia-v1\\nNamespace:  default\\nImage(s):   luksa/kubia:v1\\nSelector:   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd307978b502a5b975ed4045ae4964-orig \\nOkay, but doesn’t this mean the first controller now sees zero pods matching its selec-\\ntor, because the three pods previously created by it contain only the app=kubia label?\\nNo, because kubectl had also modified the labels of the live pods just before modify-\\ning the ReplicationController’s selector:\\n$ kubectl get po --show-labels\\nNAME            READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE  LABELS\\nkubia-v1-m33mv  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nkubia-v1-nmzw9  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nkubia-v1-cdtey  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nIf this is getting too complicated, examine figure 9.6, which shows the pods, their\\nlabels, and the two ReplicationControllers, along with their pod selectors.\\nReplicationController: kubia-v1\\nReplicas: 3\\nSelector: app=kubia,\\ndeployment=3ddd…\\nReplicationController: kubia-v2\\nReplicas: 0\\nSelector: app=kubia,\\ndeployment=757d...\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\nFigure 9.6\\nDetailed state of the old and new ReplicationControllers and pods at the start of a rolling \\nupdate\\n \\n',\n",

What’s so wrong with this process that a bet-\\nter one had to be introduced? \\n Well, for starters, I, for one, don’t like Kubernetes modifying objects I’ve created.\\nOkay, it’s perfectly fine for the scheduler to assign a node to my pods after I create\\nthem, but Kubernetes modifying the labels of my pods and the label selectors of my\\nReplicationControllers is something that I don’t expect and could cause me to go\\naround the office yelling at my colleagues, “Who’s been messing with my controllers!?!?” \\n But even more importantly, if you’ve paid close attention to the words I’ve used,\\nyou probably noticed that all this time I said explicitly that the kubectl client was the\\none performing all these steps of the rolling update. \\n You can see this by turning on verbose logging with the --v option when triggering\\nthe rolling update:\\n$ kubectl rolling-update kubia-v1 kubia-v2 --image=luksa/kubia:v2 --v 6\\nTIP\\nUsing the --v 6 option increases the logging level enough to let you see\\nthe requests kubectl is sending to the API server.\\nUsing this option, kubectl will print out each HTTP request it sends to the Kuberne-\\ntes API server. You’ll see PUT requests to\\n/api/v1/namespaces/default/replicationcontrollers/kubia-v1\\nwhich is the RESTful URL representing your kubia-v1 ReplicationController resource.\\nThese requests are the ones scaling down your ReplicationController, which shows\\nListing 9.6\\nThe final steps performed by kubectl rolling-update\\n \\n',\n",

Well, in your case, the update went smoothly, but what if you\\nlost network connectivity while kubectl was performing the update? The update pro-\\ncess would be interrupted mid-way. Pods and ReplicationControllers would end up in\\nan intermediate state.\\n Another reason why performing an update like this isn’t as good as it could be is\\nbecause it’s imperative. Throughout this book, I’ve stressed how Kubernetes is about\\nyou telling it the desired state of the system and having Kubernetes achieve that\\nstate on its own, by figuring out the best way to do it. This is how pods are deployed\\nand how pods are scaled up and down. You never tell Kubernetes to add an addi-\\ntional pod or remove an excess one—you change the number of desired replicas\\nand that’s it.\\n Similarly, you will also want to change the desired image tag in your pod defini-\\ntions and have Kubernetes replace the pods with new ones running the new image.\\nThis is exactly what drove the introduction of a new resource called a Deployment,\\nwhich is now the preferred way of deploying applications in Kubernetes. \\n9.3\\nUsing Deployments for updating apps declaratively\\nA Deployment is a higher-level resource meant for deploying applications and\\nupdating them declaratively, instead of doing it through a ReplicationController or\\na ReplicaSet, which are both considered lower-level concepts.\\n When you create a Deployment, a ReplicaSet resource is created underneath\\n(eventually more of them). As you may remember from chapter 4, ReplicaSets are a\\nnew generation of ReplicationControllers, and should be used instead of them. Replica-\\nSets replicate and manage pods, as well. When using a Deployment, the actual pods\\nare created and managed by the Deployment’s ReplicaSets, not by the Deployment\\ndirectly (the relationship is shown in figure 9.8).\\nYou might wonder why you’d want to complicate things by introducing another object\\non top of a ReplicationController or ReplicaSet, when they’re what suffices to keep a set\\nof pod instances running. As the rolling update example in section 9.2 demonstrates,\\nwhen updating the app, you need to introduce an additional ReplicationController and\\nPods\\nReplicaSet\\nDeployment\\nFigure 9.8\\nA Deployment is backed \\nby a ReplicaSet, which supervises the \\ndeployment’s pods.\\n \\n',\n",

A\\nDeployment is also composed of a label selector, a desired replica count, and a pod\\ntemplate. In addition to that, it also contains a field, which specifies a deployment\\nstrategy that defines how an update should be performed when the Deployment\\nresource is modified.  \\nCREATING A DEPLOYMENT MANIFEST\\nLet’s see how to use the kubia-v1 ReplicationController example from earlier in this\\nchapter and modify it so it describes a Deployment instead of a ReplicationController.\\nAs you’ll see, this requires only three trivial changes.

Be aware that kubectl explain shows the older version.\\nBecause the ReplicationController from before was managing a specific version of the\\npods, you called it kubia-v1. A Deployment, on the other hand, is above that version\\nstuff.

Earlier, when you used a ReplicationController\\nto create pods, their names were composed of the name of the controller plus a ran-\\ndomly generated string (for example, kubia-v1-m33mv). The three pods created by\\nthe Deployment include an additional numeric value in the middle of their names.\\nWhat is that exactly?\\n The number corresponds to the hashed value of the pod template in the Deploy-\\nment and the ReplicaSet managing these pods. As we said earlier, a Deployment\\ndoesn’t manage pods directly. Instead, it creates ReplicaSets and leaves the managing\\nto them, so let’s look at the ReplicaSet created by your Deployment:\\n$ kubectl get replicasets\\nNAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia-1506449474   3         3         10s\\nThe ReplicaSet’s name also contains the hash value of its pod template.

Using the hash value of the pod template like this allows the Deployment\\nto always use the same (possibly existing) ReplicaSet for a given version of the pod\\ntemplate.\\nACCESSING THE PODS THROUGH THE SERVICE\\nWith the three replicas created by this ReplicaSet now running, you can use the Ser-\\nvice you created a while ago to access them, because you made the new pods’ labels\\nmatch the Service’s label selector. \\n Up until this point, you probably haven’t seen a good-enough reason why you should\\nuse Deployments over ReplicationControllers. Luckily, creating a Deployment also hasn’t\\nbeen any harder than creating a ReplicationController. Now, you’ll start doing things\\nwith this Deployment, which will make it clear why Deployments are superior. This will\\nbecome clear in the next few moments, when you see how updating the app through\\na Deployment resource compares to updating it through a ReplicationController.\\n9.3.2\\nUpdating a Deployment\\nPreviously, when you ran your app using a ReplicationController, you had to explicitly\\ntell Kubernetes to perform the update by running kubectl rolling-update. You even\\nhad to specify the name for the new ReplicationController that should replace the old\\none. Kubernetes replaced all the original pods with new ones and deleted the original\\nReplicationController at the end of the process. During the process, you basically had\\nto stay around, keeping your terminal open and waiting for kubectl to finish the roll-\\ning update. \\n Now compare this to how you’re about to update a Deployment. The only thing\\nyou need to do is modify the pod template defined in the Deployment resource and\\nKubernetes will take all the steps necessary to get the actual system state to what’s\\ndefined in the resource. Similar to scaling a ReplicationController or ReplicaSet up or\\ndown, all you need to do is reference a new image tag in the Deployment’s pod tem-\\nplate and leave it to Kubernetes to transform your system so it matches the new\\ndesired state.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABLE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES\\nHow this new state should be achieved is governed by the deployment strategy config-\\nured on the Deployment itself. The default strategy is to perform a rolling update (the\\nstrategy is called RollingUpdate). The alternative is the Recreate strategy, which\\ndeletes all the old pods at once and then creates new ones, similar to modifying a\\nReplicationController’s pod template and then deleting all the pods (we talked about\\nthis in section 9.1.1).\\n The Recreate strategy causes all old pods to be deleted before the new ones are\\ncreated. Use this strategy when your application doesn’t support running multiple ver-\\nsions in parallel and requires the old version to be stopped completely before the\\nnew one is started. This strategy does involve a short period of time when your app\\nbecomes completely unavailable.\\n \\n',\n",

The upper and lower limits for the number of pods above\\nor below the desired replica count are configurable. You should use this strategy only\\nwhen your app can handle running both the old and new version at the same time.\\nSLOWING DOWN THE ROLLING UPDATE FOR DEMO PURPOSES\\nIn the next exercise, you’ll use the RollingUpdate strategy, but you need to slow down\\nthe update process a little, so you can see that the update is indeed performed in a\\nrolling fashion. You can do that by setting the minReadySeconds attribute on the\\nDeployment. We’ll explain what this attribute does by the end of this chapter. For\\nnow, set it to 10 seconds with the kubectl patch command.\\n$ kubectl patch deployment kubia -p \\'{\"spec\": {\"minReadySeconds\": 10}}\\'\\n\"kubia\" patched\\nTIP\\nThe kubectl patch command is useful for modifying a single property\\nor a limited number of properties of a resource without having to edit its defi-\\nnition in a text editor.\\nYou used the patch command to change the spec of the Deployment. This doesn’t\\ncause any kind of update to the pods, because you didn’t change the pod template.\\nChanging other Deployment properties, like the desired replica count or the deploy-\\nment strategy, also doesn’t trigger a rollout, because it doesn’t affect the existing indi-\\nvidual pods in any way.\\nTRIGGERING THE ROLLING UPDATE\\nIf you’d like to track the update process as it progresses, first run the curl loop again\\nin another terminal to see what’s happening with the requests (don’t forget to replace\\nthe IP with the actual external IP of your service):\\n$ while true; do curl http://130.211.109.222; done\\nTo trigger the actual rollout, you’ll change the image used in the single pod container\\nto luksa/kubia:v2. Instead of editing the whole YAML of the Deployment object or\\nusing the patch command to change the image, you’ll use the kubectl set image\\ncommand, which allows changing the image of any resource that contains a container\\n(ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and so on). You’ll use it to modify\\nyour Deployment like this:\\n$ kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2\\ndeployment \"kubia\" image updated\\nWhen you execute this command, you’re updating the kubia Deployment’s pod tem-\\nplate so the image used in its nodejs container is changed to luksa/kubia:v2 (from\\n:v1).

This works much like the rolling update per-\\nformed by kubectl.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE AWESOMENESS OF DEPLOYMENTS\\nLet’s think about what has happened. By changing the pod template in your Deploy-\\nment resource, you’ve updated your app to a newer version—by changing a single\\nfield! \\n The controllers running as part of the Kubernetes control plane then performed\\nthe update. The process wasn’t performed by the kubectl client, like it was when you\\nused kubectl rolling-update.

One way to trigger an update when you need to modify an app’s con-\\nfig is to create a new ConfigMap and modify the pod template so it references\\nthe new ConfigMap.\\nThe events that occurred below the Deployment’s surface during the update are simi-\\nlar to what happened during the kubectl rolling-update. An additional ReplicaSet\\nwas created and it was then scaled up slowly, while the previous ReplicaSet was scaled\\ndown to zero (the initial and final states are shown in figure 9.10).\\nYou can still see the old ReplicaSet next to the new one if you list them:\\n$ kubectl get rs\\nNAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia-1506449474   0         0         24m\\nkubia-1581357123   3         3         23m\\nPods: v1\\nReplicaSet: v1\\nReplicas: --\\nBefore\\nAfter\\nReplicaSet: v2\\nReplicas: ++\\nDeployment\\nPods: v2\\nReplicaSet: v1\\nReplicaSet: v2\\nDeployment\\nFigure 9.10\\nA Deployment at the start and end of a rolling update\\n \\n',\n",

As\\nyou’ll see later, the history is stored in the underlying ReplicaSets. When a rollout\\ncompletes, the old ReplicaSet isn’t deleted, and this enables rolling back to any revi-\\nsion, not only the previous one. The revision history can be displayed with the\\nkubectl rollout history command:\\n$ kubectl rollout history deployment kubia\\ndeployments \"kubia\":\\nREVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE\\n2           kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2\\n3           kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v3\\nRemember the --record command-line option you used when creating the Deploy-\\nment? Without it, the CHANGE-CAUSE column in the revision history would be empty,\\nmaking it much harder to figure out what’s behind each revision.\\nROLLING BACK TO A SPECIFIC DEPLOYMENT REVISION\\nYou can roll back to a specific revision by specifying the revision in the undo com-\\nmand. For example, if you want to roll back to the first version, you’d execute the fol-\\nlowing command:\\n$ kubectl rollout undo deployment kubia --to-revision=1\\nRemember the inactive ReplicaSet left over when you modified the Deployment the\\nfirst time? The ReplicaSet represents the first revision of your Deployment. All Replica-\\nSets created by a Deployment represent the complete revision history, as shown in fig-\\nure 9.11. Each ReplicaSet stores the complete information of the Deployment at that\\nspecific revision, so you shouldn’t delete it manually. If you do, you’ll lose that specific\\nrevision from the Deployment’s history, preventing you from rolling back to it.\\nBut having old ReplicaSets cluttering your ReplicaSet list is not ideal, so the length of\\nthe revision history is limited by the revisionHistoryLimit property on the Deploy-\\nment resource. It defaults to two, so normally only the current and the previous revision\\nare shown in the history (and only the current and the previous ReplicaSet are pre-\\nserved). Older ReplicaSets are deleted automatically. \\nDeployment\\nv1 ReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nPods: v1\\nReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nRevision 2\\nRevision 4\\nRevision 3\\nRevision 1\\nRevision history\\nCurrent revision\\nFigure 9.11\\nA Deployment’s ReplicaSets also act as its revision history.\\n \\n',\n",

If the desired replica count is \\nset to four, there will never be more than five pod instances running at the same \\ntime during an update. When converting a percentage to an absolute number, \\nthe number is rounded up. Instead of a percentage, the value can also be an \\nabsolute value (for example, one or two additional pods can be allowed).\\nmaxUnavailable\\nDetermines how many pod instances can be unavailable relative to the desired \\nreplica count during the update. It also defaults to 25%, so the number of avail-\\nable pod instances must never fall below 75% of the desired replica count. Here, \\nwhen converting a percentage to an absolute number, the number is rounded \\ndown. If the desired replica count is set to four and the percentage is 25%, only \\none pod can be unavailable.

That’s why the rollout process immediately\\ndeletes one pod and creates two new ones. This ensures two pods are available and\\nthat the maximum number of pods isn’t exceeded (the maximum is four in this\\ncase—three plus one from maxSurge). As soon as the two new pods are available, the\\ntwo remaining old pods are deleted.\\n This is a bit hard to grasp, especially since the maxUnavailable property leads you\\nto believe that that’s the maximum number of unavailable pods that are allowed. If\\nyou look at the previous figure closely, you’ll see two unavailable pods in the second\\ncolumn even though maxUnavailable is set to 1. \\n It’s important to keep in mind that maxUnavailable is relative to the desired\\nreplica count. If the replica count is set to three and maxUnavailable is set to one,\\nthat means that the update process must always keep at least two (3 minus 1) pods\\navailable, while the number of pods that aren’t available can exceed one.\\n9.3.5\\nPausing the rollout process\\nAfter the bad experience with version 3 of your app, imagine you’ve now fixed the bug\\nand pushed version 4 of your image. You’re a little apprehensive about rolling it out\\nacross all your pods the way you did before. What you want is to run a single v4 pod\\nnext to your existing v2 pods and see how it behaves with only a fraction of all your\\nusers. Then, once you’re sure everything’s okay, you can replace all the old pods with\\nnew ones. \\n You could achieve this by running an additional pod either directly or through an\\nadditional Deployment, ReplicationController, or ReplicaSet, but you do have another\\noption available on the Deployment itself. A Deployment can also be paused during\\nthe rollout process. This allows you to verify that everything is fine with the new ver-\\nsion before proceeding with the rest of the rollout.\\nPAUSING THE ROLLOUT\\nI’ve prepared the v4 image, so go ahead and trigger the rollout by changing the image\\nto luksa/kubia:v4, but then immediately (within a few seconds) pause the rollout:\\n$ kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v4\\ndeployment \"kubia\" image updated\\n$ kubectl rollout pause deployment kubia\\ndeployment \"kubia\" paused\\nA single new pod should have been created, but all original pods should also still be\\nrunning. Once the new pod is up, a part of all requests to the service will be redirected\\nto the new pod. This way, you’ve effectively run a canary release. A canary release is a\\ntechnique for minimizing the risk of rolling out a bad version of an application and it\\naffecting all your users. Instead of rolling out the new version to everyone, you replace\\nonly one or a small number of old pods with new ones. This way only a small number\\nof users will initially hit the new version.

In the future, a new upgrade strategy may do that automati-\\ncally, but currently, the proper way of performing a canary release is by using two dif-\\nferent Deployments and scaling them appropriately. \\nUSING THE PAUSE FEATURE TO PREVENT ROLLOUTS\\nPausing a Deployment can also be used to prevent updates to the Deployment from\\nkicking off the rollout process, allowing you to make multiple changes to the Deploy-\\nment and starting the rollout only when you’re done making all the necessary changes.\\nOnce you’re ready for changes to take effect, you resume the Deployment and the\\nrollout process will start.\\nNOTE\\nIf a Deployment is paused, the undo command won’t undo it until you\\nresume the Deployment.\\n9.3.6\\nBlocking rollouts of bad versions\\nBefore you conclude this chapter, we need to discuss one more property of the Deploy-\\nment resource. Remember the minReadySeconds property you set on the Deployment\\nat the beginning of section 9.3.2? You used it to slow down the rollout, so you could see\\nit was indeed performing a rolling update and not replacing all the pods at once. The\\nmain function of minReadySeconds is to prevent deploying malfunctioning versions, not\\nslowing down a deployment for fun. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE APPLICABILITY OF MINREADYSECONDS\\nThe minReadySeconds property specifies how long a newly created pod should be\\nready before the pod is treated as available. Until the pod is available, the rollout pro-\\ncess will not continue (remember the maxUnavailable property?). A pod is ready\\nwhen readiness probes of all its containers return a success. If a new pod isn’t func-\\ntioning properly and its readiness probe starts failing before minReadySeconds have\\npassed, the rollout of the new version will effectively be blocked.\\n You used this property to slow down your rollout process by having Kubernetes\\nwait 10 seconds after a pod was ready before continuing with the rollout. Usually,\\nyou’d set minReadySeconds to something much higher to make sure pods keep report-\\ning they’re ready after they’ve already started receiving actual traffic. \\n \\n',\n",

This requirement is\\nfairly common in distributed stateful applications. Certain apps require the adminis-\\ntrator to list all the other cluster members and their IP addresses (or hostnames) in\\neach member’s configuration file.

The proper\\nclean and simple way of running these special types of applications in Kubernetes is\\nthrough a StatefulSet. \\n10.2\\nUnderstanding StatefulSets\\nInstead of using a ReplicaSet to run these types of pods, you create a StatefulSet\\nresource, which is specifically tailored to applications where instances of the applica-\\ntion must be treated as non-fungible individuals, with each one having a stable name\\nand state. \\n10.2.1 Comparing StatefulSets with ReplicaSets\\nTo understand the purpose of StatefulSets, it’s best to compare them to ReplicaSets or\\nReplicationControllers. But first let me explain them with a little analogy that’s widely\\nused in the field.\\nUNDERSTANDING STATEFUL PODS WITH THE PETS VS. CATTLE ANALOGY\\nYou may have already heard of the pets vs. cattle analogy. If not, let me explain it. We\\ncan treat our apps either as pets or as cattle. \\nNOTE\\nStatefulSets were initially called PetSets. That name comes from the\\npets vs. cattle analogy explained here.\\nWe tend to treat our app instances as pets, where we give each instance a name and\\ntake care of each instance individually. But it’s usually better to treat instances as cattle\\nand not pay special attention to each individual instance. This makes it easy to replace\\nunhealthy instances without giving it a second thought, similar to the way a farmer\\nreplaces unhealthy cattle. \\n Instances of a stateless app, for example, behave much like heads of cattle. It\\ndoesn’t matter if an instance dies—you can create a new instance and people won’t\\nnotice the difference. \\n On the other hand, with stateful apps, an app instance is more like a pet. When a\\npet dies, you can’t go buy a new one and expect people not to notice. To replace a lost\\npet, you need to find a new one that looks and behaves exactly like the old one. In the\\ncase of apps, this means the new instance needs to have the same state and identity as\\nthe old one.\\nCOMPARING STATEFULSETS WITH REPLICASETS OR REPLICATIONCONTROLLERS\\nPod replicas managed by a ReplicaSet or ReplicationController are much like cattle.\\nBecause they’re mostly stateless, they can be replaced with a completely new pod\\nreplica at any time. Stateful pods require a different approach. When a stateful pod\\ninstance dies (or the node it’s running on fails), the pod instance needs to be resur-\\nrected on another node, but the new instance needs to get the same name, network\\nidentity, and state as the one it’s replacing. This is what happens when the pods are\\nmanaged through a StatefulSet. \\n \\n',\n",

It also allows you to easily scale the number of pets up and down. A\\nStatefulSet, like a ReplicaSet, has a desired replica count field that determines how\\nmany pets you want running at that time. Similar to ReplicaSets, pods are created from\\na pod template specified as part of the StatefulSet (remember the cookie-cutter anal-\\nogy?). But unlike pods created by ReplicaSets, pods created by the StatefulSet aren’t\\nexact replicas of each other. Each can have its own set of volumes—in other words,\\nstorage (and thus persistent state)—which differentiates it from its peers. Pet pods\\nalso have a predictable (and stable) identity instead of each new pod instance getting\\na completely random one. \\n10.2.2 Providing a stable network identity\\nEach pod created by a StatefulSet is assigned an ordinal index (zero-based), which\\nis then used to derive the pod’s name and hostname, and to attach stable storage to\\nthe pod. The names of the pods are thus predictable, because each pod’s name is\\nderived from the StatefulSet’s name and the ordinal index of the instance. Rather\\nthan the pods having random names, they’re nicely organized, as shown in the next\\nfigure.\\nINTRODUCING THE GOVERNING SERVICE\\nBut it’s not all about the pods having a predictable name and hostname. Unlike regu-\\nlar pods, stateful pods sometimes need to be addressable by their hostname, whereas\\nstateless pods usually don’t. After all, each stateless pod is like any other. When you\\nneed one, you pick any one of them. But with stateful pods, you usually want to oper-\\nate on a specific pod from the group, because they differ from each other (they hold\\ndifferent state, for example). \\n For this reason, a StatefulSet requires you to create a corresponding governing\\nheadless Service that’s used to provide the actual network identity to each pod.\\nThrough this Service, each pod gets its own DNS entry, so its peers and possibly other\\nclients in the cluster can address the pod by its hostname. For example, if the govern-\\ning Service belongs to the default namespace and is called foo, and one of the pods\\nReplicaSet A\\nPod A-fewrb\\nPod A-jwqec\\nPod A-dsfwx\\nStatefulSet A\\nPod A-1\\nPod A-2\\nPod A-0\\nFigure 10.5\\nPods created by a StatefulSet have predictable names (and hostnames), \\nunlike those created by a ReplicaSet\\n \\n',\n",

This holds true even for stateful pods.\\nEven if the pod is scheduled to a different node, it will still be available and reachable\\nunder the same hostname as before. \\nSCALING A STATEFULSET\\nScaling the StatefulSet creates a new pod instance with the next unused ordinal index.\\nIf you scale up from two to three instances, the new instance will get index 2 (the exist-\\ning instances obviously have indexes 0 and 1). \\n The nice thing about scaling down a StatefulSet is the fact that you always know\\nwhat pod will be removed. Again, this is also in contrast to scaling down a ReplicaSet,\\nwhere you have no idea what instance will be deleted, and you can’t even specify\\nwhich one you want removed first (but this feature may be introduced in the future).\\nScaling down a StatefulSet always removes the instances with the highest ordinal index\\nfirst (shown in figure 10.7). This makes the effects of a scale-down predictable.\\nBecause certain stateful applications don’t handle rapid scale-downs nicely, Stateful-\\nSets scale down only one pod instance at a time. A distributed data store, for example,\\nmay lose data if multiple nodes go down at the same time. For example, if a replicated\\ndata store is configured to store two copies of each data entry, in cases where two\\nnodes go down at the same time, a data entry would be lost if it was stored on exactly\\nthose two nodes. If the scale-down was sequential, the distributed data store has time\\nto create an additional replica of the data entry somewhere else to replace the (single)\\nlost copy.\\n For this exact reason, StatefulSets also never permit scale-down operations if any of\\nthe instances are unhealthy.

In chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolume-\\nClaims, which allow persistent storage to be attached to a pod by referencing the\\nPersistentVolumeClaim in the pod by name. Because PersistentVolumeClaims map\\nto PersistentVolumes one-to-one, each pod of a StatefulSet needs to reference a dif-\\nferent PersistentVolumeClaim to have its own separate PersistentVolume. Because\\nall pod instances are stamped from the same pod template, how can they each refer\\nto a different PersistentVolumeClaim? And who creates these claims? Surely you’re\\nnot expected to create as many PersistentVolumeClaims as the number of pods you\\nplan to have in the StatefulSet upfront? Of course not.\\nTEAMING UP POD TEMPLATES WITH VOLUME CLAIM TEMPLATES\\nThe StatefulSet has to create the PersistentVolumeClaims as well, the same way it’s cre-\\nating the pods. For this reason, a StatefulSet can also have one or more volume claim\\ntemplates, which enable it to stamp out PersistentVolumeClaims along with each pod\\ninstance (see figure 10.8).\\nThe PersistentVolumes for the claims can either be provisioned up-front by an admin-\\nistrator or just in time through dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes, as explained\\nat the end of chapter 6. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE CREATION AND DELETION OF PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIMS\\nScaling up a StatefulSet by one creates two or more API objects (the pod and one or\\nmore PersistentVolumeClaims referenced by the pod). Scaling down, however, deletes\\nonly the pod, leaving the claims alone. The reason for this is obvious, if you consider\\nwhat happens when a claim is deleted. After a claim is deleted, the PersistentVolume it\\nwas bound to gets recycled or deleted and its contents are lost. \\n Because stateful pods are meant to run stateful applications, which implies that the\\ndata they store in the volume is important, deleting the claim on scale-down of a Stateful-\\nSet could be catastrophic—especially since triggering a scale-down is as simple as\\ndecreasing the replicas field of the StatefulSet.

If you accidentally\\nscale down a StatefulSet, you can undo the mistake by scaling up again and the new\\npod will get the same persisted state again (as well as the same name).\\n10.2.4 Understanding StatefulSet guarantees\\nAs you’ve seen so far, StatefulSets behave differently from ReplicaSets or Replication-\\nControllers.

With pods\\nmanaged by a ReplicaSet, this isn’t a problem, because the apps are obviously made to\\nwork on the same files. Also, ReplicaSets create pods with a randomly generated iden-\\ntity, so there’s no way for two processes to run with the same identity. \\nINTRODUCING STATEFULSET’S AT-MOST-ONE SEMANTICS\\nKubernetes must thus take great care to ensure two stateful pod instances are never\\nrunning with the same identity and are bound to the same PersistentVolumeClaim. A\\nStatefulSet must guarantee at-most-one semantics for stateful pod instances. \\n This means a StatefulSet must be absolutely certain that a pod is no longer run-\\nning before it can create a replacement pod. This has a big effect on how node fail-\\nures are handled. We’ll demonstrate this later in the chapter. Before we can do that,\\nhowever, you need to create a StatefulSet and see how it behaves. You’ll also learn a\\nfew more things about them along the way.\\n10.3\\nUsing a StatefulSet\\nTo properly show StatefulSets in action, you’ll build your own little clustered data\\nstore. Nothing fancy—more like a data store from the Stone Age. \\n10.3.1 Creating the app and container image\\nYou’ll use the kubia app you’ve used throughout the book as your starting point. You’ll\\nexpand it so it allows you to store and retrieve a single data entry on each pod instance. \\n The important parts of the source code of your data store are shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\n...\\nconst dataFile = \"/var/data/kubia.txt\";\\n...\\nvar handler = function(request, response) {\\n  if (request.method == \\'POST\\') {                \\n    var file = fs.createWriteStream(dataFile);                     \\n    file.on(\\'open\\', function (fd) {                                \\n      request.pipe(file);                                          \\n      console.log(\"New data has been received and stored.\");       \\n      response.writeHead(200);                                     \\n      response.end(\"Data stored on pod \" + os.hostname() + \"\\\\n\");  \\n    });\\n  } else {                                       \\n    var data = fileExists(dataFile)                                \\n      ? fs.readFileSync(dataFile, \\'utf8\\')                          \\n      : \"No data posted yet\";                                      \\n    response.writeHead(200);                                       \\n    response.write(\"You\\'ve hit \" + os.hostname() + \"\\\\n\");          \\n    response.end(\"Data stored on this pod: \" + data + \"\\\\n\");       \\n  }\\n};\\nListing 10.1\\nA simple stateful app: kubia-pet-image/app.js\\nOn POST \\nrequests, store \\nthe request’s \\nbody into a \\ndata file.\\nOn GET (and all \\nother types of) \\nrequests, return \\nyour hostname \\nand the contents \\nof the data file.\\n \\n',\n",

This is the first\\nversion of your app. It’s not clustered yet, but it’s enough to get you started.

If your cluster supports dynamic provisioning, you don’t\\nneed to create any PersistentVolumes manually (you can skip the next section). If it\\ndoesn’t, you’ll need to create them as explained in the next section. \\nCREATING THE PERSISTENT VOLUMES\\nYou’ll need three PersistentVolumes, because you’ll be scaling the StatefulSet up to\\nthree replicas. You must create more if you plan on scaling the StatefulSet up more\\nthan that.\\n If you’re using Minikube, deploy the PersistentVolumes defined in the Chapter06/\\npersistent-volumes-hostpath.yaml file in the book’s code archive. \\n If you’re using Google Kubernetes Engine, you’ll first need to create the actual\\nGCE Persistent Disks like this:\\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west1-b pv-a\\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west1-b pv-b\\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west1-b pv-c\\nNOTE\\nMake sure to create the disks in the same zone that your nodes are\\nrunning in.\\nListing 10.2\\nDockerfile for the stateful app: kubia-pet-image/Dockerfile\\n \\n',\n",

You\\ncan’t communicate with your pods through the Service you created because it’s head-\\nless.

This time, you’ll\\ntry another option. You’ll use the API server as a proxy to the pods. \\nCOMMUNICATING WITH PODS THROUGH THE API SERVER\\nOne useful feature of the API server is the ability to proxy connections directly to indi-\\nvidual pods. If you want to perform requests against your kubia-0 pod, you hit the fol-\\nlowing URL:\\n<apiServerHost>:<port>/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/kubia-0/proxy/<path>\\nBecause the API server is secured, sending requests to pods through the API server is\\ncumbersome (among other things, you need to pass the authorization token in each\\nrequest).

Is there an existing,\\nwell-known technology you can use that makes this possible? How about the Domain\\nName System (DNS)? Depending on how much you know about DNS, you probably\\nunderstand what an A, CNAME, or MX record is used for. Other lesser-known types of\\nDNS records also exist. One of them is the SRV record.\\nINTRODUCING SRV RECORDS\\nSRV records are used to point to hostnames and ports of servers providing a specific\\nservice. Kubernetes creates SRV records to point to the hostnames of the pods back-\\ning a headless service. \\n You’re going to list the SRV records for your stateful pods by running the dig DNS\\nlookup tool inside a new temporary pod. This is the command you’ll use:\\n$ kubectl run -it srvlookup --image=tutum/dnsutils --rm \\n➥ --restart=Never -- dig SRV kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\\nThe command runs a one-off pod (--restart=Never) called srvlookup, which is\\nattached to the console (-it) and is deleted as soon as it terminates (--rm). The\\npod runs a single container from the tutum/dnsutils image and runs the following\\ncommand:\\ndig SRV kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\\nThe following listing shows what the command prints out.\\n...\\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\\nk.d.s.c.l. 30 IN  SRV     10 33 0 kubia-0.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\nk.d.s.c.l. 30 IN  SRV     10 33 0 kubia-1.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\n;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:\\nkubia-0.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 172.17.0.4\\nkubia-1.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 172.17.0.6\\n...\\nNOTE\\nI’ve had to shorten the actual name to get records to fit into a single\\nline, so kubia.d.s.c.l is actually kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\nThe ANSWER SECTION shows two SRV records pointing to the two pods backing your head-\\nless service. Each pod also gets its own A record, as shown in ADDITIONAL SECTION.\\n For a pod to get a list of all the other pods of a StatefulSet, all you need to do is\\nperform an SRV DNS lookup. In Node.js, for example, the lookup is performed\\nlike this:\\ndns.resolveSrv(\"kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\", callBackFunction);\\nYou’ll use this command in your app to enable each pod to discover its peers.\\nListing 10.8\\nListing DNS SRV records of your headless Service\\n \\n',\n",

Don’t expect to always see kubia-0 listed before kubia-1.\\n10.4.1 Implementing peer discovery through DNS\\nYour Stone Age data store isn’t clustered yet. Each data store node runs completely\\nindependently of all the others—no communication exists between them. You’ll get\\nthem talking to each other next.\\n Data posted by clients connecting to your data store cluster through the kubia-\\npublic Service lands on a random cluster node. The cluster can store multiple data\\nentries, but clients currently have no good way to see all those entries. Because ser-\\nvices forward requests to pods randomly, a client would need to perform many\\nrequests until it hit all the pods if it wanted to get the data from all the pods. \\n You can improve this by having the node respond with data from all the cluster\\nnodes. To do this, the node needs to find all its peers.

When a node fails\\nabruptly, Kubernetes can’t know the state of the node or its pods. It can’t know\\nwhether the pods are no longer running, or if they still are and are possibly even still\\nreachable, and it’s only the Kubelet that has stopped reporting the node’s state to\\nthe master.\\n Because a StatefulSet guarantees that there will never be two pods running with\\nthe same identity and storage, when a node appears to have failed, the StatefulSet can-\\nnot and should not create a replacement pod until it knows for certain that the pod is\\nno longer running. \\n It can only know that when the cluster administrator tells it so. To do that, the\\nadmin needs to either delete the pod or delete the whole node (doing so then deletes\\nall the pods scheduled to the node).\\n As your final exercise in this chapter, you’ll look at what happens to StatefulSets\\nand their pods when one of the cluster nodes gets disconnected from the network.\\n10.5.1 Simulating a node’s disconnection from the network \\nAs in chapter 4, you’ll simulate the node disconnecting from the network by shutting\\ndown the node’s eth0 network interface. Because this example requires multiple\\nnodes, you can’t run it on Minikube. You’ll use Google Kubernetes Engine instead.\\nSHUTTING DOWN THE NODE’S NETWORK ADAPTER\\nTo shut down a node’s eth0 interface, you need to ssh into one of the nodes like this:\\n$ gcloud compute ssh gke-kubia-default-pool-32a2cac8-m0g1\\nListing 10.11\\nReading from the data store\\n \\n\",\n",

You can see this\\nwhen listing nodes, as the following listing shows.\\n$ kubectl get node\\nNAME                                   STATUS     AGE       VERSION\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-32a2cac8-596v   Ready      16m       v1.6.2\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-32a2cac8-m0g1   NotReady   16m       v1.6.2\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-32a2cac8-sgl7   Ready      16m       v1.6.2\\nBecause the control plane is no longer getting status updates from the node, the\\nstatus of all pods on that node is Unknown.

But if the pod’s status remains unknown for more\\nthan a few minutes (this time is configurable), the pod is automatically evicted from\\nthe node. This is done by the master (the Kubernetes control plane). It evicts the pod\\nby deleting the pod resource. \\n When the Kubelet sees that the pod has been marked for deletion, it starts ter-\\nminating the pod.

To refresh\\nyour memory, the components that make up the Control Plane are\\n\\uf0a1The etcd distributed persistent storage\\n\\uf0a1The API server\\n\\uf0a1The Scheduler\\n\\uf0a1The Controller Manager\\nThese components store and manage the state of the cluster, but they aren’t what runs\\nthe application containers. \\nCOMPONENTS RUNNING ON THE WORKER NODES\\nThe task of running your containers is up to the components running on each\\nworker node:\\n\\uf0a1The Kubelet\\n\\uf0a1The Kubernetes Service Proxy (kube-proxy)\\n\\uf0a1The Container Runtime (Docker, rkt, or others)\\nADD-ON COMPONENTS\\nBeside the Control Plane components and the components running on the nodes, a\\nfew add-on components are required for the cluster to provide everything discussed\\nso far. This includes\\n\\uf0a1The Kubernetes DNS server\\n\\uf0a1The Dashboard\\n\\uf0a1An Ingress controller\\n\\uf0a1Heapster, which we’ll talk about in chapter 14\\n\\uf0a1The Container Network Interface network plugin (we’ll explain it later in this\\nchapter)\\n11.1.1 The distributed nature of Kubernetes components\\nThe previously mentioned components all run as individual processes. The compo-\\nnents and their inter-dependencies are shown in figure 11.1.\\n \\n',\n",

They don’t\\ntalk to each other directly. The API server is the only component that communicates\\nwith etcd. None of the other components communicate with etcd directly, but instead\\nmodify the cluster state by talking to the API server.\\n Connections between the API server and the other components are almost always\\ninitiated by the components, as shown in figure 11.1. But the API server does connect\\nto the Kubelet when you use kubectl to fetch logs, use kubectl attach to connect to\\na running container, or use the kubectl port-forward command.\\nNOTE\\nThe kubectl attach command is similar to kubectl exec, but it attaches\\nto the main process running in the container instead of running an addi-\\ntional one.\\nRUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS\\nAlthough the components on the worker nodes all need to run on the same node,\\nthe components of the Control Plane can easily be split across multiple servers. There\\nChecking the status of the Control Plane components\\nThe API server exposes an API resource called ComponentStatus, which shows the\\nhealth status of each Control Plane component.

You may be surprised\\nto hear this, but it will all make sense later when we talk about the Kubelet. \\n The Kubelet is the only component that always runs as a regular system compo-\\nnent, and it’s the Kubelet that then runs all the other components as pods. To run the\\nControl Plane components as pods, the Kubelet is also deployed on the master. The\\nnext listing shows pods in the kube-system namespace in a cluster created with\\nkubeadm, which is explained in appendix B.\\n$ kubectl get po -o custom-columns=POD:metadata.name,NODE:spec.nodeName \\n➥ --sort-by spec.nodeName -n kube-system\\nPOD                              NODE\\nkube-controller-manager-master   master      \\nkube-dns-2334855451-37d9k        master      \\netcd-master                      master      \\nkube-apiserver-master            master      \\nkube-scheduler-master            master      \\nkube-flannel-ds-tgj9k            node1      \\nkube-proxy-ny3xm                 node1      \\nkube-flannel-ds-0eek8            node2      \\nkube-proxy-sp362                 node2      \\nkube-flannel-ds-r5yf4            node3      \\nkube-proxy-og9ac                 node3      \\nAs you can see in the listing, all the Control Plane components are running as pods on\\nthe master node.

Because it’s distributed,\\nyou can run more than one etcd instance to provide both high availability and bet-\\nter performance.\\n The only component that talks to etcd directly is the Kubernetes API server. All\\nother components read and write data to etcd indirectly through the API server. This\\nbrings a few benefits, among them a more robust optimistic locking system as well as\\nvalidation; and, by abstracting away the actual storage mechanism from all the other\\ncomponents, it’s much simpler to replace it in the future. It’s worth emphasizing that\\netcd is the only place Kubernetes stores cluster state and metadata.\\nHOW RESOURCES ARE STORED IN ETCD\\nAs I’m writing this, Kubernetes can use either etcd version 2 or version 3, but version 3\\nis now recommended because of improved performance. etcd v2 stores keys in a hier-\\narchical key space, which makes key-value pairs similar to files in a file system. Each\\nkey in etcd is either a directory, which contains other keys, or is a regular key with a\\ncorresponding value. etcd v3 doesn’t support directories, but because the key format\\nremains the same (keys can include slashes), you can still think of them as being\\ngrouped into directories. Kubernetes stores all its data in etcd under /registry. The\\nfollowing listing shows a list of keys stored under /registry.\\n$ etcdctl ls /registry\\n/registry/configmaps\\n/registry/daemonsets\\n/registry/deployments\\n/registry/events\\n/registry/namespaces\\n/registry/pods\\n...\\nAbout optimistic concurrency control\\nOptimistic concurrency control (sometimes referred to as optimistic locking) is a\\nmethod where instead of locking a piece of data and preventing it from being read or\\nupdated while the lock is in place, the piece of data includes a version number. Every\\ntime the data is updated, the version number increases. When updating the data, the\\nversion number is checked to see if it has increased between the time the client read\\nthe data and the time it submits the update. If this happens, the update is rejected\\nand the client must re-read the new data and try to update it again. \\nThe result is that when two clients try to update the same data entry, only the first\\none succeeds.\\nAll Kubernetes resources include a metadata.resourceVersion field, which clients\\nneed to pass back to the API server when updating an object. If the version doesn’t\\nmatch the one stored in etcd, the API server rejects the update.\\nListing 11.2\\nTop-level entries stored in etcd by Kubernetes\\n \\n',\n",

A single compo-\\nnent not adhering fully to the mechanism may lead to inconsistent data. \\n Kubernetes improves this by requiring all other Control Plane components to go\\nthrough the API server. This way updates to the cluster state are always consistent, because\\nthe optimistic locking mechanism is implemented in a single place, so less chance exists,\\nif any, of error. The API server also makes sure that the data written to the store is always\\nvalid and that changes to the data are only performed by authorized clients. \\nENSURING CONSISTENCY WHEN ETCD IS CLUSTERED\\nFor ensuring high availability, you’ll usually run more than a single instance of etcd.\\nMultiple etcd instances will need to remain consistent. Such a distributed system\\nneeds to reach a consensus on what the actual state is. etcd uses the RAFT consensus\\nalgorithm to achieve this, which ensures that at any given moment, each node’s state is\\neither what the majority of the nodes agrees is the current state or is one of the previ-\\nously agreed upon states. \\n Clients connecting to different nodes of an etcd cluster will either see the actual\\ncurrent state or one of the states from the past (in Kubernetes, the only etcd client is\\nthe API server, but there may be multiple instances). \\n The consensus algorithm requires a majority (or quorum) for the cluster to progress\\nto the next state. As a result, if the cluster splits into two disconnected groups of nodes,\\nthe state in the two groups can never diverge, because to transition from the previous\\nstate to the new one, there needs to be more than half of the nodes taking part in\\nthe state change. If one group contains the majority of all nodes, the other one obvi-\\nously doesn’t. The first group can modify the cluster state, whereas the other one can’t.\\nWhen the two groups reconnect, the second group can catch up with the state in the\\nfirst group (see figure 11.2).\\nClients(s)\\nClients(s)\\nClients(s)\\netcd-0\\netcd-1\\netcd-2\\nThe nodes know\\nthere are three nodes\\nin the etcd cluster.\\netcd-0\\netcd-1\\nThese two nodes know\\nthey still have quorum\\nand can accept state\\nchanges from clients.\\netcd-2\\nThis node knows it does\\nnot have quorum and\\nshould therefore not\\nallow state changes.\\nNetwork\\nsplit\\nFigure 11.2\\nIn a split-brain scenario, only the side which still has the majority (quorum) accepts \\nstate changes.\\n \\n',\n",

I’m sure you’d like to know\\nwhy. Let’s compare having two vs. having one instance. Having two instances requires\\nboth instances to be present to have a majority. If either of them fails, the etcd cluster\\ncan’t transition to a new state because no majority exists. Having two instances is worse\\nthan having only a single instance. By having two, the chance of the whole cluster fail-\\ning has increased by 100%, compared to that of a single-node cluster failing. \\n The same applies when comparing three vs. four etcd instances. With three instances,\\none instance can fail and a majority (of two) still exists. With four instances, you need\\nthree nodes for a majority (two aren’t enough). In both three- and four-instance clus-\\nters, only a single instance may fail. But when running four instances, if one fails, a\\nhigher possibility exists of an additional instance of the three remaining instances fail-\\ning (compared to a three-node cluster with one failed node and two remaining nodes).\\n Usually, for large clusters, an etcd cluster of five or seven nodes is sufficient. It can\\nhandle a two- or a three-node failure, respectively, which suffices in almost all situations. \\n11.1.3 What the API server does\\nThe Kubernetes API server is the central component used by all other components\\nand by clients, such as kubectl. It provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\\ninterface for querying and modifying the cluster state over a RESTful API. It stores\\nthat state in etcd.\\n In addition to providing a consistent way of storing objects in etcd, it also performs\\nvalidation of those objects, so clients can’t store improperly configured objects (which\\nthey could if they were writing to the store directly). Along with validation, it also han-\\ndles optimistic locking, so changes to an object are never overridden by other clients\\nin the event of concurrent updates.\\n One of the API server’s clients is the command-line tool kubectl you’ve been\\nusing from the beginning of the book. When creating a resource from a JSON file, for\\nexample, kubectl posts the file’s contents to the API server through an HTTP POST\\nrequest. Figure 11.3 shows what happens inside the API server when it receives the\\nrequest.

This is per-\\nformed by one or more authentication plugins configured in the API server. The API\\nserver calls these plugins in turn, until one of them determines who is sending the\\nrequest. It does this by inspecting the HTTP request. \\n Depending on the authentication method, the user can be extracted from the cli-\\nent’s certificate or an HTTP header, such as Authorization, which you used in chap-\\nter 8. The plugin extracts the client’s username, user ID, and groups the user belongs\\nto. This data is then used in the next stage, which is authorization.\\nAUTHORIZING THE CLIENT WITH AUTHORIZATION PLUGINS\\nBesides authentication plugins, the API server is also configured to use one or more\\nauthorization plugins. Their job is to determine whether the authenticated user can\\nperform the requested action on the requested resource. For example, when creating\\npods, the API server consults all authorization plugins in turn, to determine whether\\nthe user can create pods in the requested namespace. As soon as a plugin says the user\\ncan perform the action, the API server progresses to the next stage.\\nVALIDATING AND/OR MODIFYING THE RESOURCE IN THE REQUEST WITH ADMISSION CONTROL PLUGINS\\nIf the request is trying to create, modify, or delete a resource, the request is sent\\nthrough Admission Control. Again, the server is configured with multiple Admission\\nControl plugins. These plugins can modify the resource for different reasons. They\\nmay initialize fields missing from the resource specification to the configured default\\nvalues or even override them. They may even modify other related resources, which\\naren’t in the request, and can also reject a request for whatever reason. The resource\\npasses through all Admission Control plugins.\\nNOTE\\nWhen the request is only trying to read data, the request doesn’t go\\nthrough the Admission Control.\\nExamples of Admission Control plugins include\\n\\uf0a1\\nAlwaysPullImages—Overrides the pod’s imagePullPolicy to Always, forcing\\nthe image to be pulled every time the pod is deployed.\\n\\uf0a1\\nServiceAccount—Applies the default service account to pods that don’t specify\\nit explicitly.\\n\\uf0a1\\nNamespaceLifecycle—Prevents creation of pods in namespaces that are in the\\nprocess of being deleted, as well as in non-existing namespaces.\\n\\uf0a1\\nResourceQuota—Ensures pods in a certain namespace only use as much CPU\\nand memory as has been allotted to the namespace.

For example, it\\ndoesn’t create pods when you create a ReplicaSet resource and it doesn’t manage the\\nendpoints of a service. That’s what controllers in the Controller Manager do. \\n But the API server doesn’t even tell these controllers what to do. All it does is\\nenable those controllers and other components to observe changes to deployed\\nresources. A Control Plane component can request to be notified when a resource is\\ncreated, modified, or deleted. This enables the component to perform whatever task\\nit needs in response to a change of the cluster metadata.\\n Clients watch for changes by opening an HTTP connection to the API server.\\nThrough this connection, the client will then receive a stream of modifications to the\\nwatched objects. Every time an object is updated, the server sends the new version of\\nthe object to all connected clients watching the object. Figure 11.4 shows how clients\\ncan watch for changes to pods and how a change to one of the pods is stored into etcd\\nand then relayed to all clients watching pods at that moment.\\nOne of the API server’s clients is the kubectl tool, which also supports watching\\nresources. For example, when deploying a pod, you don’t need to constantly poll the list\\nof pods by repeatedly executing kubectl get pods. Instead, you can use the --watch\\nflag and be notified of each creation, modification, or deletion of a pod, as shown in\\nthe following listing.\\n$ kubectl get pods --watch\\nNAME                    READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE\\nListing 11.6\\nWatching a pod being created and then deleted\\nVarious\\nclients\\nkubectl\\nAPI server\\n1.

This is left to the Scheduler. From afar, the operation of the Scheduler looks\\nsimple. All it does is wait for newly created pods through the API server’s watch mech-\\nanism and assign a node to each new pod that doesn’t already have the node set. \\n The Scheduler doesn’t instruct the selected node (or the Kubelet running on that\\nnode) to run the pod. All the Scheduler does is update the pod definition through the\\nAPI server. The API server then notifies the Kubelet (again, through the watch mech-\\nanism described previously) that the pod has been scheduled. As soon as the Kubelet\\non the target node sees the pod has been scheduled to its node, it creates and runs the\\npod’s containers.\\n Although a coarse-grained view of the scheduling process seems trivial, the actual\\ntask of selecting the best node for the pod isn’t that simple. Sure, the simplest\\nScheduler could pick a random node and not care about the pods already running on\\nthat node. On the other side of the spectrum, the Scheduler could use advanced tech-\\nniques such as machine learning to anticipate what kind of pods are about to be\\nscheduled in the next minutes or hours and schedule pods to maximize future hard-\\nware utilization without requiring any rescheduling of existing pods. Kubernetes’\\ndefault Scheduler falls somewhere in between. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE DEFAULT SCHEDULING ALGORITHM\\nThe selection of a node can be broken down into two parts, as shown in figure 11.5:\\n\\uf0a1Filtering the list of all nodes to obtain a list of acceptable nodes the pod can be\\nscheduled to.\\n\\uf0a1Prioritizing the acceptable nodes and choosing the best one. If multiple nodes\\nhave the highest score, round-robin is used to ensure pods are deployed across\\nall of them evenly.\\n \\n',\n",

These check various things\\nsuch as\\n\\uf0a1Can the node fulfill the pod’s requests for hardware resources? You’ll learn how\\nto specify them in chapter 14.\\n\\uf0a1Is the node running out of resources (is it reporting a memory or a disk pres-\\nsure condition)? \\n\\uf0a1If the pod requests to be scheduled to a specific node (by name), is this the node?\\n\\uf0a1Does the node have a label that matches the node selector in the pod specifica-\\ntion (if one is defined)?\\n\\uf0a1If the pod requests to be bound to a specific host port (discussed in chapter 13),\\nis that port already taken on this node or not? \\n\\uf0a1If the pod requests a certain type of volume, can this volume be mounted for\\nthis pod on this node, or is another pod on the node already using the same\\nvolume?\\n\\uf0a1Does the pod tolerate the taints of the node? Taints and tolerations are explained\\nin chapter 16.\\n\\uf0a1Does the pod specify node and/or pod affinity or anti-affinity rules? If yes,\\nwould scheduling the pod to this node break those rules? This is also explained\\nin chapter 16.\\nAll these checks must pass for the node to be eligible to host the pod. After perform-\\ning these checks on every node, the Scheduler ends up with a subset of the nodes. Any\\nof these nodes could run the pod, because they have enough available resources for\\nthe pod and conform to all requirements you’ve specified in the pod definition.\\nSELECTING THE BEST NODE FOR THE POD\\nEven though all these nodes are acceptable and can run the pod, several may be a\\nbetter choice than others. Suppose you have a two-node cluster. Both nodes are eli-\\ngible, but one is already running 10 pods, while the other, for whatever reason, isn’t\\nrunning any pods right now.

If these two nodes are provided by the cloud infrastructure, it may be bet-\\nter to schedule the pod to the first node and relinquish the second node back to the\\ncloud provider to save money. \\nADVANCED SCHEDULING OF PODS\\nConsider another example. Imagine having multiple replicas of a pod. Ideally, you’d\\nwant them spread across as many nodes as possible instead of having them all sched-\\nuled to a single one. Failure of that node would cause the service backed by those\\npods to become unavailable. But if the pods were spread across different nodes, a sin-\\ngle node failure would barely leave a dent in the service’s capacity. \\n Pods belonging to the same Service or ReplicaSet are spread across multiple nodes\\nby default. It’s not guaranteed that this is always the case. But you can force pods to be\\nspread around the cluster or kept close together by defining pod affinity and anti-\\naffinity rules, which are explained in chapter 16. \\n Even these two simple cases show how complex scheduling can be, because it\\ndepends on a multitude of factors. Because of this, the Scheduler can either be config-\\nured to suit your specific needs or infrastructure specifics, or it can even be replaced\\nwith a custom implementation altogether. You could also run a Kubernetes cluster\\nwithout a Scheduler, but then you’d have to perform the scheduling manually.\\nUSING MULTIPLE SCHEDULERS\\nInstead of running a single Scheduler in the cluster, you can run multiple Schedulers.\\nThen, for each pod, you specify the Scheduler that should schedule this particular\\npod by setting the schedulerName property in the pod spec.\\n Pods without this property set are scheduled using the default Scheduler, and so\\nare pods with schedulerName set to default-scheduler. All other pods are ignored by\\nthe default Scheduler, so they need to be scheduled either manually or by another\\nScheduler watching for such pods. \\n You can implement your own Schedulers and deploy them in the cluster, or you\\ncan deploy an additional instance of Kubernetes’ Scheduler with different configura-\\ntion options.\\n11.1.6 Introducing the controllers running in the Controller Manager\\nAs previously mentioned, the API server doesn’t do anything except store resources in\\netcd and notify clients about the change. The Scheduler only assigns a node to the\\npod, so you need other active components to make sure the actual state of the system\\nconverges toward the desired state, as specified in the resources deployed through the\\nAPI server. This work is done by controllers running inside the Controller Manager. \\n The single Controller Manager process currently combines a multitude of control-\\nlers performing various reconciliation tasks. Eventually those controllers will be split\\nup into separate processes, enabling you to replace each one with a custom imple-\\nmentation if necessary.

Resources\\nare descriptions of what should be running in the cluster, whereas the controllers are\\nthe active Kubernetes components that perform actual work as a result of the deployed\\nresources.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT CONTROLLERS DO AND HOW THEY DO IT\\nControllers do many different things, but they all watch the API server for changes to\\nresources (Deployments, Services, and so on) and perform operations for each change,\\nwhether it’s a creation of a new object or an update or deletion of an existing object.\\nMost of the time, these operations include creating other resources or updating the\\nwatched resources themselves (to update the object’s status, for example).\\n In general, controllers run a reconciliation loop, which reconciles the actual state\\nwith the desired state (specified in the resource’s spec section) and writes the new\\nactual state to the resource’s status section. Controllers use the watch mechanism to\\nbe notified of changes, but because using watches doesn’t guarantee the controller\\nwon’t miss an event, they also perform a re-list operation periodically to make sure\\nthey haven’t missed anything.\\n Controllers never talk to each other directly. They don’t even know any other con-\\ntrollers exist. Each controller connects to the API server and, through the watch\\nmechanism described in section 11.1.3, asks to be notified when a change occurs in\\nthe list of resources of any type the controller is responsible for. \\n We’ll briefly look at what each of the controllers does, but if you’d like an in-depth\\nview of what they do, I suggest you look at their source code directly. The sidebar\\nexplains how to get started.\\nA few pointers on exploring the controllers’ source code\\nIf you’re interested in seeing exactly how these controllers operate, I strongly encour-\\nage you to browse through their source code. To make it easier, here are a few tips:\\nThe source code for the controllers is available at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/\\nkubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller.\\nEach controller usually has a constructor in which it creates an Informer, which is\\nbasically a listener that gets called every time an API object gets updated.

We talked about how ReplicationControllers work in chapter 4.\\nIt’s not the ReplicationControllers that do the actual work, but the Replication Man-\\nager. Let’s quickly review what the controller does, because this will help you under-\\nstand the rest of the controllers.\\n In chapter 4, we said that the operation of a ReplicationController could be\\nthought of as an infinite loop, where in each iteration, the controller finds the num-\\nber of pods matching its pod selector and compares the number to the desired replica\\ncount. \\n Now that you know how the API server can notify clients through the watch\\nmechanism, it’s clear that the controller doesn’t poll the pods in every iteration, but\\nis instead notified by the watch mechanism of each change that may affect the\\ndesired replica count or the number of matched pods (see figure 11.6). Any such\\nchanges trigger the controller to recheck the desired vs. actual replica count and act\\naccordingly.\\n You already know that when too few pod instances are running, the Replication-\\nController runs additional instances. But it doesn’t actually run them itself. It creates\\nan Informer listens for changes to a specific type of resource. Looking at the con-\\nstructor will show you which resources the controller is watching.\\nNext, go look for the worker() method. In it, you’ll find the method that gets invoked\\neach time the controller needs to do something. The actual function is often stored\\nin a field called syncHandler or something similar. This field is also initialized in the\\nconstructor, so that’s where you’ll find the name of the function that gets called. That\\nfunction is the place where all the magic happens.\\nController Manager\\nWatches\\nCreates and\\ndeletes\\nReplication\\nManager\\nAPI server\\nReplicationController\\nresources\\nPod resources\\nOther resources\\nFigure 11.6\\nThe Replication Manager watches for changes to API \\nobjects.\\n \\n',\n",

This is how all controllers operate.\\nTHE REPLICASET, THE DAEMONSET, AND THE JOB CONTROLLERS\\nThe ReplicaSet controller does almost the same thing as the Replication Manager\\ndescribed previously, so we don’t have much to add here. The DaemonSet and Job\\ncontrollers are similar. They create Pod resources from the pod template defined in\\ntheir respective resources. Like the Replication Manager, these controllers don’t run\\nthe pods, but post Pod definitions to the API server, letting the Kubelet create their\\ncontainers and run them.\\nTHE DEPLOYMENT CONTROLLER\\nThe Deployment controller takes care of keeping the actual state of a deployment in\\nsync with the desired state specified in the corresponding Deployment API object. \\n The Deployment controller performs a rollout of a new version each time a\\nDeployment object is modified (if the modification should affect the deployed pods).\\nIt does this by creating a ReplicaSet and then appropriately scaling both the old and\\nthe new ReplicaSet based on the strategy specified in the Deployment, until all the old\\npods have been replaced with new ones. It doesn’t create any pods directly.\\nTHE STATEFULSET CONTROLLER\\nThe StatefulSet controller, similarly to the ReplicaSet controller and other related\\ncontrollers, creates, manages, and deletes Pods according to the spec of a StatefulSet\\nresource. But while those other controllers only manage Pods, the StatefulSet control-\\nler also instantiates and manages PersistentVolumeClaims for each Pod instance.\\nTHE NODE CONTROLLER\\nThe Node controller manages the Node resources, which describe the cluster’s worker\\nnodes. Among other things, a Node controller keeps the list of Node objects in sync\\nwith the actual list of machines running in the cluster. It also monitors each node’s\\nhealth and evicts pods from unreachable nodes.\\n The Node controller isn’t the only component making changes to Node objects.\\nThey’re also changed by the Kubelet, and can obviously also be modified by users\\nthrough REST API calls. \\nTHE SERVICE CONTROLLER\\nIn chapter 5, when we talked about Services, you learned that a few different types\\nexist. One of them was the LoadBalancer service, which requests a load balancer from\\nthe infrastructure to make the service available externally. The Service controller is\\nthe one requesting and releasing a load balancer from the infrastructure, when a\\nLoadBalancer-type Service is created or deleted.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '325\\nUnderstanding the architecture\\nTHE ENDPOINTS CONTROLLER\\nYou’ll remember that Services aren’t linked directly to pods, but instead contain a list\\nof endpoints (IPs and ports), which is created and updated either manually or auto-\\nmatically according to the pod selector defined on the Service. The Endpoints con-\\ntroller is the active component that keeps the endpoint list constantly updated with\\nthe IPs and ports of pods matching the label selector.\\n As figure 11.7 shows, the controller watches both Services and Pods. When\\nServices are added or updated or Pods are added, updated, or deleted, it selects Pods\\nmatching the Service’s pod selector and adds their IPs and ports to the Endpoints\\nresource. Remember, the Endpoints object is a standalone object, so the controller\\ncreates it if necessary. Likewise, it also deletes the Endpoints object when the Service is\\ndeleted.\\nTHE NAMESPACE CONTROLLER\\nRemember namespaces (we talked about them in chapter 3)? Most resources belong\\nto a specific namespace. When a Namespace resource is deleted, all the resources in\\nthat namespace must also be deleted. This is what the Namespace controller does.\\nWhen it’s notified of the deletion of a Namespace object, it deletes all the resources\\nbelonging to the namespace through the API server. \\nTHE PERSISTENTVOLUME CONTROLLER\\nIn chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.\\nOnce a user creates a PersistentVolumeClaim, Kubernetes must find an appropriate\\nPersistentVolume and bind it to the claim. This is performed by the PersistentVolume\\ncontroller. \\n When a PersistentVolumeClaim pops up, the controller finds the best match for\\nthe claim by selecting the smallest PersistentVolume with the access mode matching\\nthe one requested in the claim and the declared capacity above the capacity requested\\nController Manager\\nWatches\\nCreates, modiﬁes,\\nand deletes\\nEndpoints\\ncontroller\\nAPI server\\nService resources\\nPod resources\\nEndpoints resources\\nFigure 11.7\\nThe Endpoints controller watches Service and Pod resources, \\nand manages Endpoints.\\n \\n',\n",

Again, all these controllers operate on the API objects through the\\nAPI server. They don’t communicate with the Kubelets directly or issue any kind of\\ninstructions to them. In fact, they don’t even know Kubelets exist. After a controller\\nupdates a resource in the API server, the Kubelets and Kubernetes Service Proxies,\\nalso oblivious of the controllers’ existence, perform their work, such as spinning up a\\npod’s containers and attaching network storage to them, or in the case of services, set-\\nting up the actual load balancing across pods. \\n The Control Plane handles one part of the operation of the whole system, so to\\nfully understand how things unfold in a Kubernetes cluster, you also need to under-\\nstand what the Kubelet and the Kubernetes Service Proxy do. We’ll learn that next.\\n11.1.7 What the Kubelet does\\nIn contrast to all the controllers, which are part of the Kubernetes Control Plane and\\nrun on the master node(s), the Kubelet and the Service Proxy both run on the worker\\nnodes, where the actual pods containers run. What does the Kubelet do exactly?\\nUNDERSTANDING THE KUBELET’S JOB\\nIn a nutshell, the Kubelet is the component responsible for everything running on a\\nworker node. Its initial job is to register the node it’s running on by creating a Node\\nresource in the API server. Then it needs to continuously monitor the API server for\\nPods that have been scheduled to the node, and start the pod’s containers. It does this\\nby telling the configured container runtime (which is Docker, CoreOS’ rkt, or some-\\nthing else) to run a container from a specific container image. The Kubelet then con-\\nstantly monitors running containers and reports their status, events, and resource\\nconsumption to the API server. \\n The Kubelet is also the component that runs the container liveness probes, restart-\\ning containers when the probes fail. Lastly, it terminates containers when their Pod is\\ndeleted from the API server and notifies the server that the pod has terminated.\\nRUNNING STATIC PODS WITHOUT THE API SERVER\\nAlthough the Kubelet talks to the Kubernetes API server and gets the pod manifests\\nfrom there, it can also run pods based on pod manifest files in a specific local direc-\\ntory as shown in figure 11.8. This feature is used to run the containerized versions of\\nthe Control Plane components as pods, as you saw in the beginning of the chapter.\\n Instead of running Kubernetes system components natively, you can put their pod\\nmanifests into the Kubelet’s manifest directory and have the Kubelet run and manage\\n \\n',\n",

When a service is\\nbacked by more than one pod, the proxy performs load balancing across those pods. \\nWHY IT’S CALLED A PROXY\\nThe initial implementation of the kube-proxy was the userspace proxy. It used an\\nactual server process to accept connections and proxy them to the pods.

This has a major impact on performance. \\n Another smaller difference is that the userspace proxy mode balanced connec-\\ntions across pods in a true round-robin fashion, while the iptables proxy mode\\ndoesn’t—it selects pods randomly. When only a few clients use a service, they may not\\nbe spread evenly across pods. For example, if a service has two backing pods but only\\nfive or so clients, don’t be surprised if you see four clients connect to pod A and only\\none client connect to pod B.

This allows pods to easily look up services by name or even the pod’s IP\\naddresses in the case of headless services.\\n The DNS server pod is exposed through the kube-dns service, allowing the pod to\\nbe moved around the cluster, like any other pod. The service’s IP address is specified\\nas the nameserver in the /etc/resolv.conf file inside every container deployed in the\\ncluster. The kube-dns pod uses the API server’s watch mechanism to observe changes\\nto Services and Endpoints and updates its DNS records with every change, allowing its\\nclients to always get (fairly) up-to-date DNS information. I say fairly because during\\nthe time between the update of the Service or Endpoints resource and the time the\\nDNS pod receives the watch notification, the DNS records may be invalid.\\nHOW (MOST) INGRESS CONTROLLERS WORK\\nUnlike the DNS add-on, you’ll find a few different implementations of Ingress con-\\ntrollers, but most of them work in the same way. An Ingress controller runs a reverse\\nproxy server (like Nginx, for example), and keeps it configured according to the\\nIngress, Service, and Endpoints resources defined in the cluster. The controller thus\\nneeds to observe those resources (again, through the watch mechanism) and change\\nthe proxy server’s config every time one of them changes. \\n Although the Ingress resource’s definition points to a Service, Ingress controllers\\nforward traffic to the service’s pod directly instead of going through the service IP.\\nThis affects the preservation of client IPs when external clients connect through the\\nIngress controller, which makes them preferred over Services in certain use cases.\\nUSING OTHER ADD-ONS\\nYou’ve seen how both the DNS server and the Ingress controller add-ons are similar to\\nthe controllers running in the Controller Manager, except that they also accept client\\nconnections instead of only observing and modifying resources through the API server. \\nListing 11.7\\nAdd-ons deployed with ReplicationControllers in Minikube\\nListing 11.8\\nThe kube-dns Deployment \\n \\n',\n",

We’ll introduce a few other add-ons in this\\nand the remaining chapters.\\n11.1.10Bringing it all together\\nYou’ve now learned that the whole Kubernetes system is composed of relatively small,\\nloosely coupled components with good separation of concerns. The API server, the\\nScheduler, the individual controllers running inside the Controller Manager, the\\nKubelet, and the kube-proxy all work together to keep the actual state of the system\\nsynchronized with what you specify as the desired state. \\n For example, submitting a pod manifest to the API server triggers a coordinated\\ndance of various Kubernetes components, which eventually results in the pod’s con-\\ntainers running. You’ll learn how this dance unfolds in the next section. \\n11.2\\nHow controllers cooperate\\nYou now know about all the components that a Kubernetes cluster is comprised of.\\nNow, to solidify your understanding of how Kubernetes works, let’s go over what hap-\\npens when a Pod resource is created. Because you normally don’t create Pods directly,\\nyou’re going to create a Deployment resource instead and see everything that must\\nhappen for the pod’s containers to be started.\\n11.2.1 Understanding which components are involved\\nEven before you start the whole process, the controllers, the Scheduler, and the\\nKubelet are watching the API server for changes to their respective resource types.\\nThis is shown in figure 11.11. The components depicted in the figure will each play a\\npart in the process you’re about to trigger.

One of those clients is the Deployment controller, which, as we discussed\\nearlier, is the active component responsible for handling Deployments. \\n As you may remember from chapter 9, a Deployment is backed by one or more\\nReplicaSets, which then create the actual pods.

The controller takes into consideration the replica count and pod selec-\\ntor defined in the ReplicaSet and verifies whether enough existing Pods match\\nthe selector.\\n The controller then creates the Pod resources based on the pod template in the\\nReplicaSet (the pod template was copied over from the Deployment when the Deploy-\\nment controller created the ReplicaSet). \\nTHE SCHEDULER ASSIGNS A NODE TO THE NEWLY CREATED PODS\\nThese newly created Pods are now stored in etcd, but they each still lack one import-\\nant thing—they don’t have an associated node yet. Their nodeName attribute isn’t set.\\nThe Scheduler watches for Pods like this, and when it encounters one, chooses the\\nbest node for the Pod and assigns the Pod to the node. The Pod’s definition now\\nincludes the name of the node it should be running on.\\n Everything so far has been happening in the Kubernetes Control Plane. None of\\nthe controllers that have taken part in this whole process have done anything tangible\\nexcept update the resources through the API server. \\nTHE KUBELET RUNS THE POD’S CONTAINERS\\nThe worker nodes haven’t done anything up to this point. The pod’s containers\\nhaven’t been started yet. The images for the pod’s containers haven’t even been down-\\nloaded yet. \\n But with the Pod now scheduled to a specific node, the Kubelet on that node can\\nfinally get to work. The Kubelet, watching for changes to Pods on the API server, sees a\\nnew Pod scheduled to its node, so it inspects the Pod definition and instructs Docker,\\nor whatever container runtime it’s using, to start the pod’s containers. The container\\nruntime then runs the containers.\\n11.2.3 Observing cluster events\\nBoth the Control Plane components and the Kubelet emit events to the API server as\\nthey perform these actions. They do this by creating Event resources, which are like\\nany other Kubernetes resource. You’ve already seen events pertaining to specific\\nresources every time you used kubectl describe to inspect those resources, but you\\ncan also retrieve events directly with kubectl get events.\\n Maybe it’s me, but using kubectl get to inspect events is painful, because they’re\\nnot shown in proper temporal order. Instead, if an event occurs multiple times, the\\nevent is displayed only once, showing when it was first seen, when it was last seen, and\\nthe number of times it occurred. Luckily, watching events with the --watch option is\\nmuch easier on the eyes and useful for seeing what’s happening in the cluster. \\n The following listing shows the events emitted in the process described previously\\n(some columns have been removed and the output is edited heavily to make it legible\\nin the limited space on the page).\\n \\n',\n",

Judging\\nfrom the COMMAND column, this additional container isn’t doing anything (the con-\\ntainer’s command is \"pause\"). If you look closely, you’ll see that this container was\\ncreated a few seconds before the Nginx container. What’s its role?\\n This pause container is the container that holds all the containers of a pod\\ntogether. Remember how all containers of a pod share the same network and other\\nLinux namespaces? The pause container is an infrastructure container whose sole\\npurpose is to hold all these namespaces. All other user-defined containers of the pod\\nthen use the namespaces of the pod infrastructure container (see figure 11.13).\\nActual application containers may die and get restarted. When such a container starts\\nup again, it needs to become part of the same Linux namespaces as before. The infra-\\nstructure container makes this possible since its lifecycle is tied to that of the pod—the\\ncontainer runs from the time the pod is scheduled until the pod is deleted. If the\\ninfrastructure pod is killed in the meantime, the Kubelet recreates it and all the pod’s\\ncontainers.\\nListing 11.10\\nListing running Docker containers\\nPod\\nContainer A\\nContainer A\\nPod infrastructure\\ncontainer\\nContainer B\\nContainer B\\nUses Linux\\nnamespaces from\\nUses Linux\\nnamespaces from\\nFigure 11.13\\nA two-container pod results in three running containers \\nsharing the same Linux namespaces.\\n \\n',\n",

How exactly does Kubernetes\\nachieve this? In short, it doesn’t. The network is set up by the system administrator or\\nby a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, not by Kubernetes itself. \\n11.4.1 What the network must be like\\nKubernetes doesn’t require you to use a specific networking technology, but it does\\nmandate that the pods (or to be more precise, their containers) can communicate\\nwith each other, regardless if they’re running on the same worker node or not. The\\nnetwork the pods use to communicate must be such that the IP address a pod sees as\\nits own is the exact same address that all other pods see as the IP address of the pod in\\nquestion. \\n Look at figure 11.14. When pod A connects to (sends a network packet to) pod B,\\nthe source IP pod B sees must be the same IP that pod A sees as its own. There should\\nbe no network address translation (NAT) performed in between—the packet sent by\\npod A must reach pod B with both the source and destination address unchanged.\\nThis is important, because it makes networking for applications running inside pods\\nsimple and exactly as if they were running on machines connected to the same net-\\nwork switch.

Pod X connects to pod Y and tells it,\\n“Hey, I’m pod X, available at IP 1.2.3.4; please send updates to me at this IP address.”\\nThe pod providing the service can connect to the first pod by using the received\\nIP address. \\n The requirement for NAT-less communication between pods also extends to pod-\\nto-node and node-to-pod communication. But when a pod communicates with ser-\\nvices out on the internet, the source IP of the packets the pod sends does need to be\\nchanged, because the pod’s IP is private. The source IP of outbound packets is\\nchanged to the host worker node’s IP address.\\n Building a proper Kubernetes cluster involves setting up the networking according\\nto these requirements. There are various methods and technologies available to do\\nthis, each with its own benefits or drawbacks in a given scenario. Because of this, we’re\\nnot going to go into specific technologies. Instead, let’s explain how inter-pod net-\\nworking works in general. \\n11.4.2 Diving deeper into how networking works\\nIn section 11.3, we saw that a pod’s IP address and network namespace are set up and\\nheld by the infrastructure container (the pause container). The pod’s containers then\\nuse its network namespace. A pod’s network interface is thus whatever is set up in the\\ninfrastructure container. Let’s see how the interface is created and how it’s connected\\nto the interfaces in all the other pods. Look at figure 11.15. We’ll discuss it next.\\nENABLING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PODS ON THE SAME NODE\\nBefore the infrastructure container is started, a virtual Ethernet interface pair (a veth\\npair) is created for the container. One interface of the pair remains in the host’s\\nnamespace (you’ll see it listed as vethXXX when you run ifconfig on the node),\\nwhereas the other is moved into the container’s network namespace and renamed\\neth0. The two virtual interfaces are like two ends of a pipe (or like two network\\ndevices connected by an Ethernet cable)—what goes in on one side comes out on the\\nother, and vice-versa. \\nNode\\nPod A\\neth0\\n10.1.1.1\\nveth123\\nPod B\\neth0\\n10.1.1.2\\nveth234\\nBridge\\n10.1.1.0/24\\nThis is pod A’s\\nveth pair.\\nThis is pod B’s\\nveth pair.\\nFigure 11.15\\nPods on a node are \\nconnected to the same bridge through \\nvirtual Ethernet interface pairs.\\n \\n',\n",

The eth0 interface in the container is\\nassigned an IP address from the bridge’s address range. Anything that an application\\nrunning inside the container sends to the eth0 network interface (the one in the con-\\ntainer’s namespace), comes out at the other veth interface in the host’s namespace\\nand is sent to the bridge. This means it can be received by any network interface that’s\\nconnected to the bridge. \\n If pod A sends a network packet to pod B, the packet first goes through pod A’s\\nveth pair to the bridge and then through pod B’s veth pair. All containers on a node\\nare connected to the same bridge, which means they can all communicate with each\\nother. But to enable communication between containers running on different nodes,\\nthe bridges on those nodes need to be connected somehow. \\nENABLING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PODS ON DIFFERENT NODES\\nYou have many ways to connect bridges on different nodes. This can be done with\\noverlay or underlay networks or by regular layer 3 routing, which we’ll look at next.\\n You know pod IP addresses must be unique across the whole cluster, so the bridges\\nacross the nodes must use non-overlapping address ranges to prevent pods on differ-\\nent nodes from getting the same IP. In the example shown in figure 11.16, the bridge\\non node A is using the 10.1.1.0/24 IP range and the bridge on node B is using\\n10.1.2.0/24, which ensures no IP address conflicts exist.\\n Figure 11.16 shows that to enable communication between pods across two nodes\\nwith plain layer 3 networking, the node’s physical network interface needs to be con-\\nnected to the bridge as well. Routing tables on node A need to be configured so all\\npackets destined for 10.1.2.0/24 are routed to node B, whereas node B’s routing\\ntables need to be configured so packets sent to 10.1.1.0/24 are routed to node A.\\n With this type of setup, when a packet is sent by a container on one of the nodes\\nto a container on the other node, the packet first goes through the veth pair, then\\nNode A\\nPod A\\nNetwork\\neth0\\n10.1.1.1\\nveth123\\nPod B\\neth0\\n10.1.1.2\\nveth234\\nBridge\\n10.1.1.0/24\\neth0\\n10.100.0.1\\nNode B\\nPod C\\neth0\\n10.1.2.1\\nveth345\\nPod D\\neth0\\n10.1.2.2\\nveth456\\nBridge\\n10.1.2.0/24\\neth0\\n10.100.0.2\\nFigure 11.16\\nFor pods on different nodes to communicate, the bridges need to be connected \\nsomehow.\\n \\n',\n",

Sure, the routers in between could be con-\\nfigured to route packets between the nodes, but this becomes increasingly difficult\\nand error-prone as the number of routers between the nodes increases. Because of\\nthis, it’s easier to use a Software Defined Network (SDN), which makes the nodes\\nappear as though they’re connected to the same network switch, regardless of the\\nactual underlying network topology, no matter how complex it is. Packets sent\\nfrom the pod are encapsulated and sent over the network to the node running the\\nother pod, where they are de-encapsulated and delivered to the pod in their origi-\\nnal form.\\n11.4.3 Introducing the Container Network Interface\\nTo make it easier to connect containers into a network, a project called Container\\nNetwork Interface (CNI) was started. The CNI allows Kubernetes to be configured to\\nuse any CNI plugin that’s out there. These plugins include\\n\\uf0a1Calico\\n\\uf0a1Flannel\\n\\uf0a1Romana\\n\\uf0a1Weave Net \\n\\uf0a1And others\\nWe’re not going to go into the details of these plugins; if you want to learn more about\\nthem, refer to https:/\\n/kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/.\\n Installing a network plugin isn’t difficult. You only need to deploy a YAML con-\\ntaining a DaemonSet and a few other supporting resources. This YAML is provided\\non each plugin’s project page. As you can imagine, the DaemonSet is used to deploy\\na network agent on all cluster nodes. It then ties into the CNI interface on the node,\\nbut be aware that the Kubelet needs to be started with --network-plugin=cni to\\nuse CNI. \\n11.5\\nHow services are implemented\\nIn chapter 5 you learned about Services, which allow exposing a set of pods at a long-\\nlived, stable IP address and port. In order to focus on what Services are meant for and\\nhow they can be used, we intentionally didn’t go into how they work. But to truly\\nunderstand Services and have a better feel for where to look when things don’t behave\\nthe way you expect, you need to understand how they are implemented. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '339\\nHow services are implemented\\n11.5.1 Introducing the kube-proxy\\nEverything related to Services is handled by the kube-proxy process running on each\\nnode. Initially, the kube-proxy was an actual proxy waiting for connections and for\\neach incoming connection, opening a new connection to one of the pods. This was\\ncalled the userspace proxy mode. Later, a better-performing iptables proxy mode\\nreplaced it. This is now the default, but you can still configure Kubernetes to use the\\nold mode if you want.\\n Before we continue, let’s quickly review a few things about Services, which are rele-\\nvant for understanding the next few paragraphs.\\n We’ve learned that each Service gets its own stable IP address and port. Clients\\n(usually pods) use the service by connecting to this IP address and port. The IP\\naddress is virtual—it’s not assigned to any network interfaces and is never listed as\\neither the source or the destination IP address in a network packet when the packet\\nleaves the node. A key detail of Services is that they consist of an IP and port pair (or\\nmultiple IP and port pairs in the case of multi-port Services), so the service IP by itself\\ndoesn’t represent anything. That’s why you can’t ping them. \\n11.5.2 How kube-proxy uses iptables\\nWhen a service is created in the API server, the virtual IP address is assigned to it\\nimmediately. Soon afterward, the API server notifies all kube-proxy agents running on\\nthe worker nodes that a new Service has been created. Then, each kube-proxy makes\\nthat service addressable on the node it’s running on. It does this by setting up a few\\niptables rules, which make sure each packet destined for the service IP/port pair is\\nintercepted and its destination address modified, so the packet is redirected to one of\\nthe pods backing the service. \\n Besides watching the API server for changes to Services, kube-proxy also watches\\nfor changes to Endpoints objects. We talked about them in chapter 5, but let me\\nrefresh your memory, as it’s easy to forget they even exist, because you rarely create\\nthem manually. An Endpoints object holds the IP/port pairs of all the pods that back\\nthe service (an IP/port pair can also point to something other than a pod). That’s\\nwhy the kube-proxy must also watch all Endpoints objects. After all, an Endpoints\\nobject changes every time a new backing pod is created or deleted, and when the\\npod’s readiness status changes or the pod’s labels change and it falls in or out of scope\\nof the service. \\n Now let’s see how kube-proxy enables clients to connect to those pods through the\\nService. This is shown in figure 11.17.\\n The figure shows what the kube-proxy does and how a packet sent by a client pod\\nreaches one of the pods backing the Service. Let’s examine what happens to the\\npacket when it’s sent by the client pod (pod A in the figure). \\n The packet’s destination is initially set to the IP and port of the Service (in the\\nexample, the Service is at 172.30.0.1:80).

One of them\\nsays that if any packet has the destination IP equal to 172.30.0.1 and destination port\\nequal to 80, the packet’s destination IP and port should be replaced with the IP and\\nport of a randomly selected pod. \\n The packet in the example matches that rule and so its destination IP/port is\\nchanged. In the example, pod B2 was randomly selected, so the packet’s destination\\nIP is changed to 10.1.2.1 (pod B2’s IP) and the port to 8080 (the target port specified\\nin the Service spec).

For running services without interruption it’s not only the apps that need to\\nbe up all the time, but also the Kubernetes Control Plane components. We’ll look at\\nwhat’s involved in achieving high availability next.\\n11.6.1 Making your apps highly available\\nWhen running apps in Kubernetes, the various controllers make sure your app keeps\\nrunning smoothly and at the specified scale even when nodes fail. To ensure your app\\nis highly available, you only need to run them through a Deployment resource and\\nconfigure an appropriate number of replicas; everything else is taken care of by\\nKubernetes. \\nRUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DOWNTIME\\nThis requires your apps to be horizontally scalable, but even if that’s not the case in\\nyour app, you should still use a Deployment with its replica count set to one. If the\\nreplica becomes unavailable, it will be replaced with a new one quickly, although that\\ndoesn’t happen instantaneously. It takes time for all the involved controllers to notice\\nthat a node has failed, create the new pod replica, and start the pod’s containers.\\nThere will inevitably be a short period of downtime in between. \\nUSING LEADER-ELECTION FOR NON-HORIZONTALLY SCALABLE APPS\\nTo avoid the downtime, you need to run additional inactive replicas along with the\\nactive one and use a fast-acting lease or leader-election mechanism to make sure only\\none is active. In case you’re unfamiliar with leader election, it’s a way for multiple app\\ninstances running in a distributed environment to come to an agreement on which is\\nthe leader. That leader is either the only one performing tasks, while all others are\\nwaiting for the leader to fail and then becoming leaders themselves, or they can all be\\nactive, with the leader being the only instance performing writes, while all the others\\nare providing read-only access to their data, for example. This ensures two instances\\nare never doing the same job, if that would lead to unpredictable system behavior due\\nto race conditions.\\n The mechanism doesn’t need to be incorporated into the app itself. You can use a\\nsidecar container that performs all the leader-election operations and signals the\\nmain container when it should become active. You’ll find an example of leader elec-\\ntion in Kubernetes at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/election.\\n Ensuring your apps are highly available is relatively simple, because Kubernetes\\ntakes care of almost everything. But what if Kubernetes itself fails? What if the servers\\nrunning the Kubernetes Control Plane components go down? How are those compo-\\nnents made highly available?\\n \\n',\n",

Figure 11.18\\nshows an overview of a highly available cluster.\\nRUNNING AN ETCD CLUSTER\\nBecause etcd was designed as a distributed system, one of its key features is the ability\\nto run multiple etcd instances, so making it highly available is no big deal. All you\\nneed to do is run it on an appropriate number of machines (three, five, or seven, as\\nexplained earlier in the chapter) and make them aware of each other. You do this by\\nincluding the list of all the other instances in every instance’s configuration. For\\nexample, when starting an instance, you specify the IPs and ports where the other etcd\\ninstances can be reached. \\n etcd will replicate data across all its instances, so a failure of one of the nodes when\\nrunning a three-machine cluster will still allow the cluster to accept both read and\\nwrite operations. To increase the fault tolerance to more than a single node, you need\\nto run five or seven etcd nodes, which would allow the cluster to handle two or three\\nNode 1\\nKubelet\\nNode 2\\nKubelet\\nNode 3\\nKubelet\\nNode 4\\nKubelet\\nNode 5\\nKubelet\\n...\\nNode N\\nKubelet\\nLoad\\nbalancer\\nMaster 3\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nMaster 2\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nMaster 1\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[active]\\n[active]\\nFigure 11.18\\nA highly-available cluster with three master nodes\\n \\n',\n",

Having more than seven etcd instances is almost never nec-\\nessary and begins impacting performance.\\nRUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF THE API SERVER\\nMaking the API server highly available is even simpler. Because the API server is (almost\\ncompletely) stateless (all the data is stored in etcd, but the API server does cache it), you\\ncan run as many API servers as you need, and they don’t need to be aware of each other\\nat all. Usually, one API server is collocated with every etcd instance. By doing this, the\\netcd instances don’t need any kind of load balancer in front of them, because every API\\nserver instance only talks to the local etcd instance. \\n The API servers, on the other hand, do need to be fronted by a load balancer, so\\nclients (kubectl, but also the Controller Manager, Scheduler, and all the Kubelets)\\nalways connect only to the healthy API server instances. \\nENSURING HIGH AVAILABILITY OF THE CONTROLLERS AND THE SCHEDULER\\nCompared to the API server, where multiple replicas can run simultaneously, run-\\nning multiple instances of the Controller Manager or the Scheduler isn’t as simple.\\nBecause controllers and the Scheduler all actively watch the cluster state and act when\\nit changes, possibly modifying the cluster state further (for example, when the desired\\nreplica count on a ReplicaSet is increased by one, the ReplicaSet controller creates an\\nadditional pod), running multiple instances of each of those components would\\nresult in all of them performing the same action. They’d be racing each other, which\\ncould cause undesired effects (creating two new pods instead of one, as mentioned in\\nthe previous example).\\n For this reason, when running multiple instances of these components, only one\\ninstance may be active at any given time. Luckily, this is all taken care of by the compo-\\nnents themselves (this is controlled with the --leader-elect option, which defaults to\\ntrue). Each individual component will only be active when it’s the elected leader. Only\\nthe leader performs actual work, whereas all other instances are standing by and waiting\\nfor the current leader to fail.

When collocated, they can talk to the\\nlocal API server directly; otherwise they connect to the API servers through the load\\nbalancer.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE LEADER ELECTION MECHANISM USED IN CONTROL PLANE COMPONENTS\\nWhat I find most interesting here is that these components don’t need to talk to each\\nother directly to elect a leader. The leader election mechanism works purely by creat-\\ning a resource in the API server. And it’s not even a special kind of resource—the End-\\npoints resource is used to achieve this (abused is probably a more appropriate term).\\n There’s nothing special about using an Endpoints object to do this. It’s used\\nbecause it has no side effects as long as no Service with the same name exists. Any\\nother resource could be used (in fact, the leader election mechanism will soon use\\nConfigMaps instead of Endpoints). \\n I’m sure you’re interested in how a resource can be used for this purpose. Let’s\\ntake the Scheduler, for example. All instances of the Scheduler try to create (and later\\nupdate) an Endpoints resource called kube-scheduler. You’ll find it in the kube-\\nsystem namespace, as the following listing shows.\\n$ kubectl get endpoints kube-scheduler -n kube-system -o yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Endpoints\\nmetadata:\\n  annotations:\\n    control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader: \\'{\"holderIdentity\":\\n      ➥ \"minikube\",\"leaseDurationSeconds\":15,\"acquireTime\":\\n      ➥ \"2017-05-27T18:54:53Z\",\"renewTime\":\"2017-05-28T13:07:49Z\",\\n      ➥ \"leaderTransitions\":0}\\'\\n  creationTimestamp: 2017-05-27T18:54:53Z\\n  name: kube-scheduler\\n  namespace: kube-system\\n  resourceVersion: \"654059\"\\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/endpoints/kube-scheduler\\n  uid: f847bd14-430d-11e7-9720-080027f8fa4e\\nsubsets: []\\nThe control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader annotation is the important part.\\nAs you can see, it contains a field called holderIdentity, which holds the name of the\\ncurrent leader. The first instance that succeeds in putting its name there becomes\\nthe leader. Instances race each other to do that, but there’s always only one winner.\\n Remember the optimistic concurrency we explained earlier? That’s what ensures\\nthat if multiple instances try to write their name into the resource only one of them\\nsucceeds. Based on whether the write succeeded or not, each instance knows whether\\nit is or it isn’t the leader. \\n Once becoming the leader, it must periodically update the resource (every two sec-\\nonds by default), so all other instances know that it’s still alive.

You’ve already learned that the API server\\nrequires clients to authenticate themselves before they’re allowed to perform opera-\\ntions on the server. And you’ve already seen how pods can authenticate by sending the\\ncontents of the file/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token, which\\nis mounted into each container’s filesystem through a secret volume.\\n But what exactly does that file represent? Every pod is associated with a Service-\\nAccount, which represents the identity of the app running in the pod. The token file\\nholds the ServiceAccount’s authentication token. When an app uses this token to con-\\nnect to the API server, the authentication plugin authenticates the ServiceAccount\\nand passes the ServiceAccount’s username back to the API server core. Service-\\nAccount usernames are formatted like this:\\nsystem:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service account name>\\nThe API server passes this username to the configured authorization plugins, which\\ndetermine whether the action the app is trying to perform is allowed to be performed\\nby the ServiceAccount.\\n ServiceAccounts are nothing more than a way for an application running inside a\\npod to authenticate itself with the API server. As already mentioned, applications do\\nthat by passing the ServiceAccount’s token in the request.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE SERVICEACCOUNT RESOURCE\\nServiceAccounts are resources just like Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and so on, and are\\nscoped to individual namespaces. A default ServiceAccount is automatically created\\nfor each namespace (that’s the one your pods have used all along). \\n You can list ServiceAccounts like you do other resources:\\n$ kubectl get sa\\nNAME      SECRETS   AGE\\ndefault   1         1d\\nNOTE\\nThe shorthand for serviceaccount is sa.\\n \\n',\n",

Each pod is associated with exactly\\none ServiceAccount, but multiple pods can use the same ServiceAccount. As you can\\nsee in figure 12.1, a pod can only use a ServiceAccount from the same namespace.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW SERVICEACCOUNTS TIE INTO AUTHORIZATION\\nYou can assign a ServiceAccount to a pod by specifying the account’s name in the pod\\nmanifest. If you don’t assign it explicitly, the pod will use the default ServiceAccount\\nin the namespace.\\n By assigning different ServiceAccounts to pods, you can control which resources\\neach pod has access to. When a request bearing the authentication token is received\\nby the API server, the server uses the token to authenticate the client sending the\\nrequest and then determines whether or not the related ServiceAccount is allowed to\\nperform the requested operation. The API server obtains this information from the\\nsystem-wide authorization plugin configured by the cluster administrator. One of\\nthe available authorization plugins is the role-based access control (RBAC) plugin,\\nwhich is discussed later in this chapter. From Kubernetes version 1.6 on, the RBAC\\nplugin is the plugin most clusters should use.\\n12.1.3 Creating ServiceAccounts\\nWe’ve said every namespace contains its own default ServiceAccount, but additional\\nones can be created if necessary. But why should you bother with creating Service-\\nAccounts instead of using the default one for all your pods? \\n The obvious reason is cluster security. Pods that don’t need to read any cluster\\nmetadata should run under a constrained account that doesn’t allow them to retrieve\\nor modify any resources deployed in the cluster.

If you look at the Secret’s data with kubectl describe secret foo-\\ntoken-qzq7j, you’ll see it contains the same items (the CA certificate, namespace, and\\ntoken) as the default ServiceAccount’s token does (the token itself will obviously be\\ndifferent), as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe secret foo-token-qzq7j\\n...\\nca.crt:         1066 bytes\\nnamespace:      7 bytes\\ntoken:          eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...\\nNOTE\\nYou’ve probably heard of JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

In case you don’t remember, they are Secrets that hold the credentials for\\npulling container images from a private image repository. \\n The following listing shows an example of a ServiceAccount definition, which\\nincludes the image pull Secret you created in chapter 7.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ServiceAccount\\nmetadata:\\n  name: my-service-account\\nimagePullSecrets:\\n- name: my-dockerhub-secret\\nA ServiceAccount’s image pull Secrets behave slightly differently than its mountable\\nSecrets.

Adding image pull Secrets to a ServiceAccount saves you from having to add\\nthem to each pod individually. \\n12.1.4 Assigning a ServiceAccount to a pod\\nAfter you create additional ServiceAccounts, you need to assign them to pods.

The only reason to use ServiceAccounts in that case is to\\nenforce mountable Secrets or to provide image pull Secrets through the Service-\\nAccount, as explained earlier. \\n But creating additional ServiceAccounts is practically a must when you use the\\nRBAC authorization plugin, which we’ll explore next.\\n12.2\\nSecuring the cluster with role-based access control\\nStarting with Kubernetes version 1.6.0, cluster security was ramped up considerably. In\\nearlier versions, if you managed to acquire the authentication token from one of the\\npods, you could use it to do anything you want in the cluster. If you google around,\\nyou’ll find demos showing how a path traversal (or directory traversal) attack (where clients\\ncan retrieve files located outside of the web server’s web root directory) can be used to\\nget the token and use it to run your malicious pods in an insecure Kubernetes cluster.\\n But in version 1.8.0, the RBAC authorization plugin graduated to GA (General\\nAvailability) and is now enabled by default on many clusters (for example, when\\ndeploying a cluster with kubadm, as described in appendix B). RBAC prevents unau-\\nthorized users from viewing or modifying the cluster state. The default Service-\\nAccount isn’t allowed to view cluster state, let alone modify it in any way, unless you\\ngrant it additional privileges. To write apps that communicate with the Kubernetes\\nAPI server (as described in chapter 8), you need to understand how to manage\\nauthorization through RBAC-specific resources.\\nNOTE\\nIn addition to RBAC, Kubernetes also includes other authorization\\nplugins, such as the Attribute-based access control (ABAC) plugin, a Web-\\nHook plugin and custom plugin implementations. RBAC is the standard,\\nthough.\\n12.2.1 Introducing the RBAC authorization plugin\\nThe Kubernetes API server can be configured to use an authorization plugin to check\\nwhether an action is allowed to be performed by the user requesting the action. Because\\nthe API server exposes a REST interface, users perform actions by sending HTTP\\nrequests to the server. Users authenticate themselves by including credentials in the\\nrequest (an authentication token, username and password, or a client certificate).\\nUNDERSTANDING ACTIONS\\nBut what actions are there? As you know, REST clients send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,\\nand other types of HTTP requests to specific URL paths, which represent specific\\nREST resources. In Kubernetes, those resources are Pods, Services, Secrets, and so on.\\nHere are a few examples of actions in Kubernetes:\\n\\uf0a1Get Pods\\n\\uf0a1Create Services\\n \\n',\n",

The\\nnouns (Pods, Service, Secrets) obviously map to Kubernetes resources. \\n An authorization plugin such as RBAC, which runs inside the API server, deter-\\nmines whether a client is allowed to perform the requested verb on the requested\\nresource or not.\\nNOTE\\nThe additional verb use is used for PodSecurityPolicy resources, which\\nare explained in the next chapter.\\nBesides applying security permissions to whole resource types, RBAC rules can also\\napply to specific instances of a resource (for example, a Service called myservice).\\nAnd later you’ll see that permissions can also apply to non-resource URL paths,\\nbecause not every path the API server exposes maps to a resource (such as the /api\\npath itself or the server health information at /healthz). \\nUNDERSTANDING THE RBAC PLUGIN\\nThe RBAC authorization plugin, as the name suggests, uses user roles as the key factor\\nin determining whether the user may perform the action or not. A subject (which may\\nbe a human, a ServiceAccount, or a group of users or ServiceAccounts) is associated\\nwith one or more roles and each role is allowed to perform certain verbs on certain\\nresources. \\n If a user has multiple roles, they may do anything that any of their roles allows\\nthem to do. If none of the user’s roles contains a permission to, for example, update\\nSecrets, the API server will prevent the user from performing PUT or PATCH requests\\non Secrets.\\n Managing authorization through the RBAC plugin is simple. It’s all done by creat-\\ning four RBAC-specific Kubernetes resources, which we’ll look at next.\\nTable 12.1\\nMapping HTTP methods to authorization verbs\\nHTTP method\\nVerb for single resource\\nVerb for collection\\nGET, HEAD\\nget (and watch for watching)\\nlist (and watch)\\nPOST\\ncreate\\nn/a\\nPUT\\nupdate\\nn/a\\nPATCH\\npatch\\nn/a\\nDELETE\\ndelete\\ndeletecollection\\n \\n',\n",

First, ensure you’re\\nusing at least version 1.6 of Kubernetes and that the RBAC plugin is the only config-\\nured authorization plugin. There can be multiple plugins enabled in parallel and if\\none of them allows an action to be performed, the action is allowed.\\nNOTE\\nIf you’re using GKE 1.6 or 1.7, you need to explicitly disable legacy autho-\\nrization by creating the cluster with the --no-enable-legacy-authorization\\noption. If you’re using Minikube, you also may need to enable RBAC by start-\\ning Minikube with --extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC\\nIf you followed the instructions on how to disable RBAC in chapter 8, now’s the time\\nto re-enable it by running the following command:\\n$ kubectl delete clusterrolebinding permissive-binding\\nTo try out RBAC, you’ll run a pod through which you’ll try to talk to the API server,\\nthe way you did in chapter 8. But this time you’ll run two pods in different namespaces\\nto see how per-namespace security behaves.\\n In the examples in chapter 8, you ran two containers to demonstrate how an appli-\\ncation in one container uses the other container to talk to the API server. This time,\\nyou’ll run a single container (based on the kubectl-proxy image) and use kubectl\\nexec to run curl inside that container directly. The proxy will take care of authentica-\\ntion and HTTPS, so you can focus on the authorization aspect of API server security.\\nNamespace C\\nNamespaced\\nresources\\nCluster-level\\nresources\\nRoleBinding\\nRoleBinding\\nRole\\nNamespace B\\nNamespaced\\nresources\\nRoleBinding\\nRole\\nNamespace A\\nNamespaced\\nresources\\nRoleBinding\\nRole\\nCluster scope (resources that aren’t namespaced)\\nClusterRoleBinding\\nClusterRole\\nFigure 12.3\\nRoles and RoleBindings are namespaced; ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings aren’t.\\n \\n',\n",

They’re not namespaced. Let’s see why\\nyou need them.\\n A regular Role only allows access to resources in the same namespace the Role is\\nin. If you want to allow someone access to resources across different namespaces, you\\nhave to create a Role and RoleBinding in every one of those namespaces. If you want\\nto extend this to all namespaces (this is something a cluster administrator would prob-\\nably need), you need to create the same Role and RoleBinding in each namespace.\\nWhen creating an additional namespace, you have to remember to create the two\\nresources there as well. \\n As you’ve learned throughout the book, certain resources aren’t namespaced at\\nall (this includes Nodes, PersistentVolumes, Namespaces, and so on). We’ve also\\nmentioned the API server exposes some URL paths that don’t represent resources\\n(/healthz for example). Regular Roles can’t grant access to those resources or non-\\nresource URLs, but ClusterRoles can.\\n A ClusterRole is a cluster-level resource for allowing access to non-namespaced\\nresources or non-resource URLs or used as a common role to be bound inside individ-\\nual namespaces, saving you from having to redefine the same role in each of them.\\nALLOWING ACCESS TO CLUSTER-LEVEL RESOURCES\\nAs mentioned, a ClusterRole can be used to allow access to cluster-level resources.\\nLet’s look at how to allow your pod to list PersistentVolumes in your cluster.

Usually, this is done for you automatically through the system:discovery\\nClusterRole and the identically named ClusterRoleBinding, which appear among\\nother predefined ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings (we’ll explore them in sec-\\ntion 12.2.5). \\n Let’s inspect the system:discovery ClusterRole shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get clusterrole system:discovery -o yaml\\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ClusterRole\\nmetadata:\\n  name: system:discovery\\n  ...\\nrules:\\n- nonResourceURLs:      \\n  - /api                \\n  - /api/*              \\n  - /apis               \\n  - /apis/*             \\n  - /healthz            \\n  - /swaggerapi         \\n  - /swaggerapi/*       \\n  - /version            \\nListing 12.14\\nThe default system:discovery ClusterRole\\nNamespace: foo\\nCluster-level resources\\nClusterRole:\\npv-reader\\nGet, list\\nPersistent\\nVolumes\\nClusterRoleBinding:\\npv-test\\nDefault ServiceAccount in\\nfoo namespace is now allowed\\nto get and list PersistentVolumes\\nService-\\nAccount:\\ndefault\\nFigure 12.8\\nA ClusterRoleBinding and ClusterRole must be used to grant access to cluster-\\nlevel resources.\\nInstead of referring \\nto resources, this rule \\nrefers to non-resource \\nURLs.\\n \\n',\n",

It allows read-\\ning most resources in a namespace, except for Roles, RoleBindings, and Secrets. You’re\\nprobably wondering, why not Secrets? Because one of those Secrets might include an\\nauthentication token with greater privileges than those defined in the view Cluster-\\nRole and could allow the user to masquerade as a different user to gain additional\\nprivileges (privilege escalation). \\nALLOWING MODIFYING RESOURCES WITH THE EDIT CLUSTERROLE\\nNext is the edit ClusterRole, which allows you to modify resources in a namespace,\\nbut also allows both reading and modifying Secrets. It doesn’t, however, allow viewing\\nor modifying Roles or RoleBindings—again, this is to prevent privilege escalation.\\nGRANTING FULL CONTROL OF A NAMESPACE WITH THE ADMIN CLUSTERROLE\\nComplete control of the resources in a namespace is granted in the admin Cluster-\\nRole. Subjects with this ClusterRole can read and modify any resource in the name-\\nspace, except ResourceQuotas (we’ll learn what those are in chapter 14) and the\\nNamespace resource itself. The main difference between the edit and the admin Cluster-\\nRoles is in the ability to view and modify Roles and RoleBindings in the namespace.\\nNOTE\\nTo prevent privilege escalation, the API server only allows users to cre-\\nate and update Roles if they already have all the permissions listed in that\\nRole (and for the same scope). \\nALLOWING COMPLETE CONTROL WITH THE CLUSTER-ADMIN CLUSTERROLE \\nComplete control of the Kubernetes cluster can be given by assigning the cluster-\\nadmin ClusterRole to a subject. As you’ve seen before, the admin ClusterRole doesn’t\\nallow users to modify the namespace’s ResourceQuota objects or the Namespace\\nresource itself. If you want to allow a user to do that, you need to create a RoleBinding\\nthat references the cluster-admin ClusterRole. This gives the user included in the\\nRoleBinding complete control over all aspects of the namespace in which the Role-\\nBinding is created.\\n If you’ve paid attention, you probably already know how to give users complete\\ncontrol of all the namespaces in the cluster. Yes, by referencing the cluster-admin\\nClusterRole in a ClusterRoleBinding instead of a RoleBinding.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE OTHER DEFAULT CLUSTERROLES\\nThe list of default ClusterRoles includes a large number of other ClusterRoles, which\\nstart with the system: prefix. These are meant to be used by the various Kubernetes\\ncomponents. Among them, you’ll find roles such as system:kube-scheduler, which\\nis obviously used by the Scheduler, system:node, which is used by the Kubelets, and\\nso on. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '373\\nSummary\\n Although the Controller Manager runs as a single pod, each controller running\\ninside it can use a separate ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding (they’re prefixed\\nwith system: controller:). \\n Each of these system ClusterRoles has a matching ClusterRoleBinding, which binds\\nit to the user the system component authenticates as. The system:kube-scheduler\\nClusterRoleBinding, for example, assigns the identically named ClusterRole to the\\nsystem:kube-scheduler user, which is the username the scheduler Authenticates as. \\n12.2.6 Granting authorization permissions wisely\\nBy default, the default ServiceAccount in a namespace has no permissions other than\\nthose of an unauthenticated user (as you may remember from one of the previous\\nexamples, the system:discovery ClusterRole and associated binding allow anyone to\\nmake GET requests on a few non-resource URLs). Therefore, pods, by default, can’t\\neven view cluster state. It’s up to you to grant them appropriate permissions to do that. \\n Obviously, giving all your ServiceAccounts the cluster-admin ClusterRole is a\\nbad idea. As is always the case with security, it’s best to give everyone only the permis-\\nsions they need to do their job and not a single permission more (principle of least\\nprivilege).\\nCREATING SPECIFIC SERVICEACCOUNTS FOR EACH POD\\nIt’s a good idea to create a specific ServiceAccount for each pod (or a set of pod rep-\\nlicas) and then associate it with a tailor-made Role (or a ClusterRole) through a\\nRoleBinding (not a ClusterRoleBinding, because that would give the pod access to\\nresources in other namespaces, which is probably not what you want). \\n If one of your pods (the application running within it) only needs to read pods,\\nwhile the other also needs to modify them, then create two different ServiceAccounts\\nand make those pods use them by specifying the serviceAccountName property in the\\npod spec, as you learned in the first part of this chapter. Don’t add all the necessary\\npermissions required by both pods to the default ServiceAccount in the namespace. \\nEXPECTING YOUR APPS TO BE COMPROMISED\\nYour aim is to reduce the possibility of an intruder getting hold of your cluster. Today’s\\ncomplex apps contain many vulnerabilities. You should expect unwanted persons to\\neventually get their hands on the ServiceAccount’s authentication token, so you should\\nalways constrain the ServiceAccount to prevent them from doing any real damage.\\n12.3\\nSummary\\nThis chapter has given you a foundation on how to secure the Kubernetes API server.\\nYou learned the following:\\n\\uf0a1Clients of the API server include both human users and applications running\\nin pods.\\n\\uf0a1Applications in pods are associated with a ServiceAccount. \\n\\uf0a1Both users and ServiceAccounts are associated with groups.\\n \\n',\n",

Likewise, each pod has its own process tree, because\\nit has its own PID namespace, and it also uses its own IPC namespace, allowing only\\nprocesses in the same pod to communicate with each other through the Inter-Process\\nCommunication mechanism (IPC).\\n13.1.1 Using the node’s network namespace in a pod\\nCertain pods (usually system pods) need to operate in the host’s default namespaces,\\nallowing them to see and manipulate node-level resources and devices. For example, a\\npod may need to use the node’s network adapters instead of its own virtual network\\nadapters. This can be achieved by setting the hostNetwork property in the pod spec\\nto true.\\n In that case, the pod gets to use the node’s network interfaces instead of having its\\nown set, as shown in figure 13.1. This means the pod doesn’t get its own IP address and\\nif it runs a process that binds to a port, the process will be bound to the node’s port.\\nYou can try running such a pod. The next listing shows an example pod manifest.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-with-host-network\\nListing 13.1\\nA pod using the node’s network namespace: pod-with-host-network.yaml\\nNode\\nPod A\\nPod’s own network\\nnamespace\\neth0\\nlo\\neth0\\ndocker0\\nlo\\neth1\\nNode’s default network\\nnamespace\\nPod B\\nhostNetwork: true\\nFigure 13.1\\nA pod \\nwith hostNetwork: \\ntrue uses the node’s \\nnetwork interfaces \\ninstead of its own.\\n \\n',\n",

In the\\nold days, traditional UNIX implementations only distinguished between privileged\\nand unprivileged processes, but for many years, Linux has supported a much more\\nfine-grained permission system through kernel capabilities.\\n Instead of making a container privileged and giving it unlimited permissions, a\\nmuch safer method (from a security perspective) is to give it access only to the kernel\\nfeatures it really requires. Kubernetes allows you to add capabilities to each container\\nor drop part of them, which allows you to fine-tune the container’s permissions and\\nlimit the impact of a potential intrusion by an attacker.\\n For example, a container usually isn’t allowed to change the system time (the hard-\\nware clock’s time). You can confirm this by trying to set the time in your pod-with-\\ndefaults pod:\\n$ kubectl exec -it pod-with-defaults -- date +%T -s \"12:00:00\"\\ndate: can\\'t set date: Operation not permitted\\nIf you want to allow the container to change the system time, you can add a capabil-\\nity called CAP_SYS_TIME to the container’s capabilities list, as shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-add-settime-capability\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: alpine\\nListing 13.11\\nAdding the CAP_SYS_TIME capability: pod-add-settime-capability.yaml\\n \\n',\n",

You’d want\\nto do that mostly for security reasons. \\n Let’s imagine you’re running a PHP application with a hidden vulnerability, allow-\\ning an attacker to write to the filesystem. The PHP files are added to the container\\nimage at build time and are served from the container’s filesystem.

Sev-\\neral of these options can also be set at the pod level (through the pod.spec.security-\\nContext property). They serve as a default for all the pod’s containers but can be\\noverridden at the container level. The pod-level security context also allows you to set\\nadditional properties, which we’ll explain next.\\n13.2.7 Sharing volumes when containers run as different users\\nIn chapter 6, we explained how volumes are used to share data between the pod’s\\ncontainers. You had no trouble writing files in one container and reading them in\\nthe other. \\n But this was only because both containers were running as root, giving them full\\naccess to all the files in the volume. Now imagine using the runAsUser option we\\nexplained earlier. You may need to run the two containers as two different users (per-\\nhaps you’re using two third-party container images, where each one runs its process\\nThis container’s filesystem \\ncan’t be written to...\\n...but writing to /volume is \\nallowed, becase a volume \\nis mounted there.\\n \\n',\n",

In one of the\\nprevious examples, you added the SYS_TIME capability to your container. If the Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy admission control plugin had been enabled, you wouldn’t have been\\nable to add that capability, unless it was specified in the PodSecurityPolicy as shown\\nin listing 13.18.\\nListing 13.18\\nSpecifying capabilities in a PodSecurityPolicy: psp-capabilities.yaml\\nAllow containers to \\nadd the SYS_TIME \\ncapability.\\nAutomatically add the CHOWN \\ncapability to every container.\\nRequire containers to \\ndrop the SYS_ADMIN and \\nSYS_MODULE capabilities.\\n \\n',\n",

If a user doesn’t want certain containers to have\\nthose capabilities, they need to explicitly drop them in the specs of those containers.\\n The example in listing 13.18 enables the automatic addition of the CAP_CHOWN capa-\\nbility to every container, thus allowing processes running in the container to change the\\nownership of files in the container (with the chown command, for example).\\nDROPPING CAPABILITIES FROM A CONTAINER\\nThe final field in this example is requiredDropCapabilities. I must admit, this was a\\nsomewhat strange name for me at first, but it’s not that complicated. The capabilities\\nlisted in this field are dropped automatically from every container (the PodSecurity-\\nPolicy Admission Control plugin will add them to every container’s security-\\nContext.capabilities.drop field). \\n If a user tries to create a pod where they explicitly add one of the capabilities listed\\nin the policy’s requiredDropCapabilities field, the pod is rejected:\\n$ kubectl create -f pod-add-sysadmin-capability.yaml\\nError from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"pod-add-sysadmin-\\ncapability.yaml\": pods \"pod-add-sysadmin-capability\" is forbidden: unable \\nto validate against any pod security policy: [capabilities.add: Invalid \\nvalue: \"SYS_ADMIN\": capability may not be added]\\n13.3.4 Constraining the types of volumes pods can use\\nThe last thing a PodSecurityPolicy resource can do is define which volume types users\\ncan add to their pods.

Does that mean it always\\napplies across all namespaces? No, because that would make them relatively unus-\\nable. After all, system pods must often be allowed to do things that regular pods\\nshouldn’t.\\n Assigning different policies to different users is done through the RBAC mecha-\\nnism described in the previous chapter. The idea is to create as many policies as you\\nneed and make them available to individual users or groups by creating ClusterRole\\nresources and pointing them to the individual policies by name. By binding those\\nClusterRoles to specific users or groups with ClusterRoleBindings, when the Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy Admission Control plugin needs to decide whether to admit a pod defi-\\nnition or not, it will only consider the policies accessible to the user creating the pod. \\n You’ll see how to do this in the next exercise. You’ll start by creating an additional\\nPodSecurityPolicy.\\nCREATING A PODSECURITYPOLICY ALLOWING PRIVILEGED CONTAINERS TO BE DEPLOYED\\nYou’ll create a special PodSecurityPolicy that will allow privileged users to create pods\\nwith privileged containers. The following listing shows the policy’s definition.\\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\\nkind: PodSecurityPolicy\\nmetadata:\\n  name: privileged          \\nspec:\\n  privileged: true        \\n  runAsUser:\\n    rule: RunAsAny\\n  fsGroup:\\n    rule: RunAsAny\\n  supplementalGroups:\\n    rule: RunAsAny\\n  seLinux:\\n    rule: RunAsAny\\n  volumes:\\n  - \\'*\\'\\nAfter you post this policy to the API server, you have two policies in the cluster:\\n$ kubectl get psp\\nNAME         PRIV    CAPS   SELINUX    RUNASUSER   FSGROUP    ...  \\ndefault      false   []     RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   ...\\nprivileged   true    []     RunAsAny   RunAsAny    RunAsAny   ...\\nNOTE\\nThe shorthand for PodSecurityPolicy is psp.\\nListing 13.20\\nA PodSecurityPolicy for privileged users: psp-privileged.yaml\\nThe name of this \\npolicy is \"privileged.”\\nIt allows running \\nprivileged containers.\\n \\n',\n",

Because you’re currently\\nlogged in as a cluster-admin, you can see all the policies. When creating pods, if any\\npolicy allows you to deploy a pod with certain features, the API server will accept\\nyour pod.\\n Now imagine two additional users are using your cluster: Alice and Bob. You want\\nAlice to only deploy restricted (non-privileged) pods, but you want to allow Bob to\\nalso deploy privileged pods. You do this by making sure Alice can only use the default\\nPodSecurityPolicy, while allowing Bob to use both.\\nUSING RBAC TO ASSIGN DIFFERENT PODSECURITYPOLICIES TO DIFFERENT USERS\\nIn the previous chapter, you used RBAC to grant users access to only certain resource\\ntypes, but I mentioned that access can be granted to specific resource instances by ref-\\nerencing them by name. That’s what you’ll use to make users use different Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy resources.\\n First, you’ll create two ClusterRoles, each allowing the use of one of the policies.\\nYou’ll call the first one psp-default and in it allow the use of the default Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy resource. You can use kubectl create clusterrole to do that:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrole psp-default --verb=use \\n➥  --resource=podsecuritypolicies --resource-name=default\\nclusterrole \"psp-default\" created\\nNOTE\\nYou’re using the special verb use instead of get, list, watch, or similar.\\nAs you can see, you’re referring to a specific instance of a PodSecurityPolicy resource by\\nusing the --resource-name option. Now, create another ClusterRole called psp-\\nprivileged, pointing to the privileged policy:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrole psp-privileged --verb=use\\n➥  --resource=podsecuritypolicies --resource-name=privileged\\nclusterrole \"psp-privileged\" created\\nNow, you need to bind these two policies to users. As you may remember from the pre-\\nvious chapter, if you’re binding a ClusterRole that grants access to cluster-level\\nresources (which is what PodSecurityPolicy resources are), you need to use a Cluster-\\nRoleBinding instead of a (namespaced) RoleBinding. \\n You’re going to bind the psp-default ClusterRole to all authenticated users, not\\nonly to Alice. This is necessary because otherwise no one could create any pods,\\nbecause the Admission Control plugin would complain that no policy is in place.\\nAuthenticated users all belong to the system:authenticated group, so you’ll bind\\nthe ClusterRole to the group:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding psp-all-users \\n➥ --clusterrole=psp-default --group=system:authenticated\\nclusterrolebinding \"psp-all-users\" created\\n \\n',\n",

Alice shouldn’t be able to create privileged pods, whereas Bob\\nshould. Let’s see if that’s true.\\nCREATING ADDITIONAL USERS FOR KUBECTL\\nBut how do you authenticate as Alice or Bob instead of whatever you’re authenticated\\nas currently? The book’s appendix A explains how kubectl can be used with multiple\\nclusters, but also with multiple contexts. A context includes the user credentials used\\nfor talking to a cluster. Turn to appendix A to find out more. Here we’ll show the bare\\ncommands enabling you to use kubectl as Alice or Bob. \\n First, you’ll create two new users in kubectl’s config with the following two\\ncommands:\\n$ kubectl config set-credentials alice --username=alice --password=password\\nUser \"alice\" set.\\n$ kubectl config set-credentials bob --username=bob --password=password\\nUser \"bob\" set.\\nIt should be obvious what the commands do. Because you’re setting username and\\npassword credentials, kubectl will use basic HTTP authentication for these two users\\n(other authentication methods include tokens, client certificates, and so on).\\nCREATING PODS AS A DIFFERENT USER\\nYou can now try creating a privileged pod while authenticating as Alice. You can tell\\nkubectl which user credentials to use by using the --user option:\\n$ kubectl --user alice create -f pod-privileged.yaml\\nError from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"pod-privileged.yaml\": \\npods \"pod-privileged\" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod \\nsecurity policy: [spec.containers[0].securityContext.privileged: Invalid \\nvalue: true: Privileged containers are not allowed]\\nAs expected, the API server doesn’t allow Alice to create privileged pods.

In the remainder of this chapter,\\nwe’ll look at how the network between pods can be secured by limiting which pods can\\ntalk to which pods.\\n Whether this is configurable or not depends on which container networking\\nplugin is used in the cluster. If the networking plugin supports it, you can configure\\nnetwork isolation by creating NetworkPolicy resources. \\n A NetworkPolicy applies to pods that match its label selector and specifies either\\nwhich sources can access the matched pods or which destinations can be accessed\\nfrom the matched pods. This is configured through ingress and egress rules, respec-\\ntively. Both types of rules can match only the pods that match a pod selector, all\\npods in a namespace whose labels match a namespace selector, or a network IP\\nblock specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation (for example,\\n192.168.1.0/24). \\n We’ll look at both ingress and egress rules and all three matching options.\\nNOTE\\nIngress rules in a NetworkPolicy have nothing to do with the Ingress\\nresource discussed in chapter 5.\\n13.4.1 Enabling network isolation in a namespace\\nBy default, pods in a given namespace can be accessed by anyone.

They’re specified for each container individually, not for the pod as\\na whole. The pod’s resource requests and limits are the sum of the requests and lim-\\nits of all its containers. \\n14.1.1 Creating pods with resource requests\\nLet’s look at an example pod manifest, which has the CPU and memory requests spec-\\nified for its single container, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: requests-pod\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: busybox\\n    command: [\"dd\", \"if=/dev/zero\", \"of=/dev/null\"]\\n    name: main              \\n    resources:              \\n      requests:             \\n        cpu: 200m          \\n        memory: 10Mi    \\nIn the pod manifest, your single container requires one-fifth of a CPU core (200 mil-\\nlicores) to run properly. Five such pods/containers can run sufficiently fast on a single\\nCPU core. \\n When you don’t specify a request for CPU, you’re saying you don’t care how much\\nCPU time the process running in your container is allotted. In the worst case, it may\\nnot get any CPU time at all (this happens when a heavy demand by other processes\\nexists on the CPU). Although this may be fine for low-priority batch jobs, which aren’t\\ntime-critical, it obviously isn’t appropriate for containers handling user requests.\\n In the pod spec, you’re also requesting 10 mebibytes of memory for the container.\\nBy doing that, you’re saying that you expect the processes running inside the con-\\ntainer to use at most 10 mebibytes of RAM. They might use less, but you’re not expect-\\ning them to use more than that in normal circumstances. Later in this chapter you’ll\\nsee what happens if they do.\\n Now you’ll run the pod.

The Minikube VM,\\nwhich is where this example is running, has two CPU cores allotted to it. That’s why\\nthe process is shown consuming 50% of the whole CPU. \\n Fifty percent of two cores is obviously one whole core, which means the container\\nis using more than the 200 millicores you requested in the pod specification. This is\\nexpected, because requests don’t limit the amount of CPU a container can use. You’d\\nneed to specify a CPU limit to do that. You’ll try that later, but first, let’s see how spec-\\nifying resource requests in a pod affects the scheduling of the pod.\\n14.1.2 Understanding how resource requests affect scheduling\\nBy specifying resource requests, you’re specifying the minimum amount of resources\\nyour pod needs. This information is what the Scheduler uses when scheduling the pod\\nto a node. Each node has a certain amount of CPU and memory it can allocate to\\npods. When scheduling a pod, the Scheduler will only consider nodes with enough\\nunallocated resources to meet the pod’s resource requirements. If the amount of\\nunallocated CPU or memory is less than what the pod requests, Kubernetes will not\\nschedule the pod to that node, because the node can’t provide the minimum amount\\nrequired by the pod.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE SCHEDULER DETERMINES IF A POD CAN FIT ON A NODE\\nWhat’s important and somewhat surprising here is that the Scheduler doesn’t look at\\nhow much of each individual resource is being used at the exact time of scheduling\\nbut at the sum of resources requested by the existing pods deployed on the node.\\nEven though existing pods may be using less than what they’ve requested, scheduling\\nanother pod based on actual resource consumption would break the guarantee given\\nto the already deployed pods.\\n This is visualized in figure 14.1. Three pods are deployed on the node. Together,\\nthey’ve requested 80% of the node’s CPU and 60% of the node’s memory. Pod D,\\nshown at the bottom right of the figure, cannot be scheduled onto the node because it\\nrequests 25% of the CPU, which is more than the 20% of unallocated CPU. The fact\\nthat the three pods are currently using only 70% of the CPU makes no difference.\\nListing 14.2\\nExamining CPU and memory usage from within a container\\n \\n',\n",

Among others, two prioritization functions rank\\nnodes based on the amount of resources requested: LeastRequestedPriority and\\nMostRequestedPriority. The first one prefers nodes with fewer requested resources\\n(with a greater amount of unallocated resources), whereas the second one is the exact\\nopposite—it prefers nodes that have the most requested resources (a smaller amount of\\nunallocated CPU and memory). But, as we’ve discussed, they both consider the amount\\nof requested resources, not the amount of resources actually consumed.\\n The Scheduler is configured to use only one of those functions. You may wonder\\nwhy anyone would want to use the MostRequestedPriority function. After all, if you\\nhave a set of nodes, you usually want to spread CPU load evenly across them. However,\\nthat’s not the case when running on cloud infrastructure, where you can add and\\nremove nodes whenever necessary. By configuring the Scheduler to use the Most-\\nRequestedPriority function, you guarantee that Kubernetes will use the smallest pos-\\nsible number of nodes while still providing each pod with the amount of CPU/memory\\nit requests. By keeping pods tightly packed, certain nodes are left vacant and can be\\nremoved. Because you’re paying for individual nodes, this saves you money.\\nINSPECTING A NODE’S CAPACITY\\nLet’s see the Scheduler in action. You’ll deploy another pod with four times the\\namount of requested resources as before. But before you do that, let’s see your node’s\\ncapacity. Because the Scheduler needs to know how much CPU and memory each\\nnode has, the Kubelet reports this data to the API server, making it available through\\nPod C\\nNode\\nPod A\\nUnallocated\\nCPU requests\\nPod B\\nPod A\\nCurrently unused\\nCPU usage\\nPod B\\nPod C\\n0%\\n100%\\nPod A\\nMemory requests\\nPod B\\nPod C\\nPod A\\nMemory usage\\nPod B\\nPod C\\nCPU requests\\nMemory requests\\nUnallocated\\nCurrently unused\\nPod D\\nPod D cannot be scheduled; its CPU\\nrequests exceed unallocated CPU\\nFigure 14.1\\nThe Scheduler only cares about requests, not actual usage.\\n \\n',\n",

Both CPU and memory requests are treated the\\nsame way by the Scheduler, but in contrast to memory requests, a pod’s CPU requests\\nalso play a role elsewhere—while the pod is running.

One has requested 200 millicores and the\\nother one five times as much. At the beginning of the chapter, we said Kubernetes dis-\\ntinguishes between resource requests and limits. You haven’t defined any limits yet, so\\nthe two pods are in no way limited when it comes to how much CPU they can each\\nconsume. If the process inside each pod consumes as much CPU time as it can, how\\nmuch CPU time does each pod get? \\n The CPU requests don’t only affect scheduling—they also determine how the\\nremaining (unused) CPU time is distributed between pods. Because your first pod\\nrequested 200 millicores of CPU and the other one 1,000 millicores, any unused CPU\\nwill be split among the two pods in a 1 to 5 ratio, as shown in figure 14.2. If both pods\\nconsume as much CPU as they can, the first pod will get one sixth or 16.7% of the\\nCPU time and the other one the remaining five sixths or 83.3%.\\nBut if one container wants to use up as much CPU as it can, while the other one is sit-\\nting idle at a given moment, the first container will be allowed to use the whole CPU\\ntime (minus the small amount of time used by the second container, if any). After all,\\nit makes sense to use all the available CPU if no one else is using it, right? As soon as\\nthe second container needs CPU time, it will get it and the first container will be throt-\\ntled back.\\n14.1.4 Defining and requesting custom resources\\nKubernetes also allows you to add your own custom resources to a node and request\\nthem in the pod’s resource requests.

This can be done by performing a\\nPATCH HTTP request. The resource name can be anything, such as example.org/my-\\nresource, as long as it doesn’t start with the kubernetes.io domain. The quantity\\nmust be an integer (for example, you can’t set it to 100 millis, because 0.1 isn’t an inte-\\nger; but you can set it to 1000m or 2000m or, simply, 1 or 2). The value will be copied\\nfrom the capacity to the allocatable field automatically.\\n Then, when creating pods, you specify the same resource name and the requested\\nquantity under the resources.requests field in the container spec or with --requests\\nwhen using kubectl run like you did in previous examples. The Scheduler will make\\nsure the pod is only deployed to a node that has the requested amount of the custom\\nresource available. Every deployed pod obviously reduces the number of allocatable\\nunits of the resource.\\n An example of a custom resource could be the number of GPU units available on the\\nnode. Pods requiring the use of a GPU specify that in their requests. The Scheduler then\\nmakes sure the pod is only scheduled to nodes with at least one GPU still unallocated.\\n14.2\\nLimiting resources available to a container\\nSetting resource requests for containers in a pod ensures each container gets the min-\\nimum amount of resources it needs. Now let’s see the other side of the coin—the\\nmaximum amount the container will be allowed to consume. \\n14.2.1 Setting a hard limit for the amount of resources a container can use\\nWe’ve seen how containers are allowed to use up all the CPU if all the other processes\\nare sitting idle. But you may want to prevent certain containers from using up more\\nthan a specific amount of CPU. And you’ll always want to limit the amount of memory\\na container can consume. \\n CPU is a compressible resource, which means the amount used by a container can\\nbe throttled without affecting the process running in the container in an adverse way.\\nMemory is obviously different—it’s incompressible. Once a process is given a chunk of\\nmemory, that memory can’t be taken away from it until it’s released by the process\\nitself. That’s why you need to limit the maximum amount of memory a container can\\nbe given. \\n Without limiting memory, a container (or a pod) running on a worker node may\\neat up all the available memory and affect all other pods on the node and any new\\npods scheduled to the node (remember that new pods are scheduled to the node\\nbased on the memory requests and not actual memory usage). A single malfunction-\\ning or malicious pod can practically make the whole node unusable.\\nCREATING A POD WITH RESOURCE LIMITS\\nTo prevent this from happening, Kubernetes allows you to specify resource limits for\\nevery container (along with, and virtually in the same way as, resource requests). The\\nfollowing listing shows an example pod manifest with resource limits.\\n \\n',\n",

As you’ve learned, a process’ CPU usage is throttled, so when a CPU\\nlimit is set for a container, the process isn’t given more CPU time than the config-\\nured limit. \\n With memory, it’s different. When a process tries to allocate memory over its\\nlimit, the process is killed (it’s said the container is OOMKilled, where OOM stands\\nfor Out Of Memory). If the pod’s restart policy is set to Always or OnFailure, the\\nprocess is restarted immediately, so you may not even notice it getting killed. But if it\\nkeeps going over the memory limit and getting killed, Kubernetes will begin restart-\\ning it with increasing delays between restarts. You’ll see a CrashLoopBackOff status\\nin that case:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME        READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE\\nmemoryhog   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   3          1m\\nThe CrashLoopBackOff status doesn’t mean the Kubelet has given up. It means that\\nafter each crash, the Kubelet is increasing the time period before restarting the con-\\ntainer. After the first crash, it restarts the container immediately and then, if it crashes\\nagain, waits for 10 seconds before restarting it again. On subsequent crashes, this\\ndelay is then increased exponentially to 20, 40, 80, and 160 seconds, and finally lim-\\nited to 300 seconds. Once the interval hits the 300-second limit, the Kubelet keeps\\nrestarting the container indefinitely every five minutes until the pod either stops\\ncrashing or is deleted. \\n To examine why the container crashed, you can check the pod’s log and/or use\\nthe kubectl describe pod command, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe pod\\nName:       memoryhog\\n...\\nContainers:\\n  main:\\n    ...\\n    State:          Terminated          \\n      Reason:       OOMKilled           \\n      Exit Code:    137\\n      Started:      Tue, 27 Dec 2016 14:55:53 +0100\\n      Finished:     Tue, 27 Dec 2016 14:55:58 +0100\\n    Last State:     Terminated            \\n      Reason:       OOMKilled             \\n      Exit Code:    137\\nListing 14.8\\nInspecting why a container terminated with kubectl describe pod\\nThe current container was \\nkilled because it was out \\nof memory (OOM).\\nThe previous container \\nwas also killed because \\nit was  OOM\\n \\n',\n",

You’ll\\nsee why in section 14.3.2, but first, let’s discuss something that catches most users off-\\nguard the first time they start specifying limits for their containers.\\n14.2.3 Understanding how apps in containers see limits\\nIf you haven’t deployed the pod from listing 14.7, deploy it now:\\n$ kubectl create -f limited-pod.yaml\\npod \"limited-pod\" created\\nNow, run the top command in the container, the way you did at the beginning of the\\nchapter. The command’s output is shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl exec -it limited-pod top\\nMem: 1450980K used, 597504K free, 22012K shrd, 65876K buff, 857552K cached\\nCPU: 10.0% usr 40.0% sys  0.0% nic 50.0% idle  0.0% io  0.0% irq  0.0% sirq\\nLoad average: 0.17 1.19 2.47 4/503 10\\n  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ CPU %CPU COMMAND\\n    1     0 root     R     1192  0.0   1 49.9 dd if /dev/zero of /dev/null\\n    5     0 root     R     1196  0.0   0  0.0 top\\nFirst, let me remind you that the pod’s CPU limit is set to 1 core and its memory limit\\nis set to 20 MiB. Now, examine the output of the top command closely. Is there any-\\nthing that strikes you as odd?\\n Look at the amount of used and free memory. Those numbers are nowhere near\\nthe 20 MiB you set as the limit for the container. Similarly, you set the CPU limit to\\none core and it seems like the main process is using only 50% of the available CPU\\ntime, even though the dd command, when used like you’re using it, usually uses all the\\nCPU it has available. What’s going on?\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT CONTAINERS ALWAYS SEE THE NODE’S MEMORY, NOT THE CONTAINER’S\\nThe top command shows the memory amounts of the whole node the container is\\nrunning on. Even though you set a limit on how much memory is available to a con-\\ntainer, the container will not be aware of this limit. \\nListing 14.9\\nRunning the top command in a CPU- and memory-limited container\\n \\n',\n",

In that case,\\nthe JVM will set the maximum heap size based on the host’s total memory instead of\\nthe memory available to the container. When you run your containerized Java apps in\\na Kubernetes cluster on your laptop, the problem doesn’t manifest itself, because the\\ndifference between the memory limits you set for the pod and the total memory avail-\\nable on your laptop is not that great. \\n But when you deploy your pod onto a production system, where nodes have much\\nmore physical memory, the JVM may go over the container’s memory limit you config-\\nured and will be OOMKilled. \\n And if you think setting the -Xmx option properly solves the issue, you’re wrong,\\nunfortunately. The -Xmx option only constrains the heap size, but does nothing about\\nthe JVM’s off-heap memory. Luckily, new versions of Java alleviate that problem by tak-\\ning the configured container limits into account.\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT CONTAINERS ALSO SEE ALL THE NODE’S CPU CORES\\nExactly like with memory, containers will also see all the node’s CPUs, regardless of\\nthe CPU limits configured for the container. Setting a CPU limit to one core doesn’t\\nmagically only expose only one CPU core to the container. All the CPU limit does is\\nconstrain the amount of CPU time the container can use. \\n A container with a one-core CPU limit running on a 64-core CPU will get 1/64th\\nof the overall CPU time. And even though its limit is set to one core, the container’s\\nprocesses will not run on only one core. At different points in time, its code may be\\nexecuted on different cores.\\n Nothing is wrong with this, right? While that’s generally the case, at least one sce-\\nnario exists where this situation is catastrophic.\\n Certain applications look up the number of CPUs on the system to decide how\\nmany worker threads they should run. Again, such an app will run fine on a develop-\\nment laptop, but when deployed on a node with a much bigger number of cores, it’s\\ngoing to spin up too many threads, all competing for the (possibly) limited CPU time.\\nAlso, each thread requires additional memory, causing the apps memory usage to sky-\\nrocket. \\n You may want to use the Downward API to pass the CPU limit to the container and\\nuse it instead of relying on the number of CPUs your app can see on the system. You\\ncan also tap into the cgroups system directly to get the configured CPU limit by read-\\ning the following files:\\n\\uf0a1/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us\\n\\uf0a1/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us\\n \\n',\n",

The QoS class is derived from the combination of resource\\nrequests and limits for the pod’s containers. Here’s how.\\nASSIGNING A POD TO THE BESTEFFORT CLASS\\nThe lowest priority QoS class is the BestEffort class. It’s assigned to pods that don’t\\nhave any requests or limits set at all (in any of their containers). This is the QoS class\\nthat has been assigned to all the pods you created in previous chapters. Containers\\nrunning in these pods have had no resource guarantees whatsoever. In the worst\\ncase, they may get almost no CPU time at all and will be the first ones killed when\\nmemory needs to be freed for other pods. But because a BestEffort pod has no\\nmemory limits set, its containers may use as much memory as they want, if enough\\nmemory is available.\\nASSIGNING A POD TO THE GUARANTEED CLASS\\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the Guaranteed QoS class. This class is given to\\npods whose containers’ requests are equal to the limits for all resources.

First in line to\\nget killed are pods in the BestEffort class, followed by Burstable pods, and finally\\nGuaranteed pods, which only get killed if system processes need memory.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW QOS CLASSES LINE UP\\nLet’s look at the example shown in figure 14.5. Imagine having two single-container\\npods, where the first one has the BestEffort QoS class, and the second one’s is\\nBurstable. When the node’s whole memory is already maxed out and one of the pro-\\ncesses on the node tries to allocate more memory, the system will need to kill one of\\nthe processes (perhaps even the process trying to allocate additional memory) to\\nhonor the allocation request. In this case, the process running in the BestEffort pod\\nwill always be killed before the one in the Burstable pod.\\nObviously, a BestEffort pod’s process will also be killed before any Guaranteed pods’\\nprocesses are killed. Likewise, a Burstable pod’s process will also be killed before that\\nof a Guaranteed pod. But what happens if there are only two Burstable pods? Clearly,\\nthe selection process needs to prefer one over the other.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS WITH THE SAME QOS CLASS ARE HANDLED\\nEach running process has an OutOfMemory (OOM) score. The system selects the\\nprocess to kill by comparing OOM scores of all the running processes. When memory\\nneeds to be freed, the process with the highest score gets killed.\\n OOM scores are calculated from two things: the percentage of the available mem-\\nory the process is consuming and a fixed OOM score adjustment, which is based on the\\npod’s QoS class and the container’s requested memory.

When a pod manifest is posted to the\\nAPI server, the LimitRanger plugin validates the pod spec. If validation fails, the mani-\\nfest is rejected immediately. Because of this, a great use-case for LimitRange objects is\\nto prevent users from creating pods that are bigger than any node in the cluster. With-\\nout such a LimitRange, the API server will gladly accept the pod, but then never\\nschedule it. \\n The limits specified in a LimitRange resource apply to each individual pod/con-\\ntainer or other kind of object created in the same namespace as the LimitRange\\nobject. They don’t limit the total amount of resources available across all the pods in\\nthe namespace. This is specified through ResourceQuota objects, which are explained\\nin section 14.5. \\n14.4.2 Creating a LimitRange object\\nLet’s look at a full example of a LimitRange and see what the individual properties do.\\nThe following listing shows the full definition of a LimitRange resource.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: LimitRange\\nmetadata:\\n  name: example\\nspec:\\n  limits:\\n  - type: Pod           \\n    min:                         \\n      cpu: 50m                   \\n      memory: 5Mi                \\n    max:                          \\n      cpu: 1                      \\n      memory: 1Gi                 \\n  - type: Container             \\n    defaultRequest:             \\n      cpu: 100m                 \\n      memory: 10Mi              \\n    default:                      \\n      cpu: 200m                   \\n      memory: 100Mi               \\n    min:                         \\n      cpu: 50m                   \\n      memory: 5Mi                \\n    max:                         \\n      cpu: 1                     \\n      memory: 1Gi                \\n    maxLimitRequestRatio:         \\n      cpu: 4                      \\n      memory: 10                  \\nListing 14.10\\nA LimitRange resource: limits.yaml\\nSpecifies the \\nlimits for a pod \\nas a whole\\nMinimum CPU and memory all the \\npod’s containers can request in total\\nMaximum CPU and memory all the pod’s \\ncontainers can request (and limit)\\nThe\\ncontainer\\nlimits are\\nspecified\\nbelow this\\nline.\\nDefault requests for CPU and memory \\nthat will be applied to containers that \\ndon’t specify them explicitly\\nDefault limits for containers \\nthat don’t specify them\\nMinimum and maximum \\nrequests/limits that a \\ncontainer can have\\nMaximum ratio between \\nthe limit and request \\nfor each resource\\n \\n',\n",

The previous listing sets the CPU maxLimitRequestRatio to 4,\\nwhich means a container’s CPU limits will not be allowed to be more than four times\\ngreater than its CPU requests. A container requesting 200 millicores will not be\\naccepted if its CPU limit is set to 801 millicores or higher. For memory, the maximum\\nratio is set to 10.\\n In chapter 6 we looked at PersistentVolumeClaims (PVC), which allow you to claim\\na certain amount of persistent storage similarly to how a pod’s containers claim CPU\\nand memory. In the same way you’re limiting the minimum and maximum amount of\\nCPU a container can request, you should also limit the amount of storage a single\\nPVC can request. A LimitRange object allows you to do that as well, as you can see at\\nthe bottom of the example.\\n The example shows a single LimitRange object containing limits for everything,\\nbut you could also split them into multiple objects if you prefer to have them orga-\\nnized per type (one for pod limits, another for container limits, and yet another for\\nPVCs, for example). Limits from multiple LimitRange objects are all consolidated\\nwhen validating a pod or PVC.\\n Because the validation (and defaults) configured in a LimitRange object is per-\\nformed by the API server when it receives a new pod or PVC manifest, if you modify\\nthe limits afterwards, existing pods and PVCs will not be revalidated—the new limits\\nwill only apply to pods and PVCs created afterward. \\n14.4.3 Enforcing the limits\\nWith your limits in place, you can now try creating a pod that requests more CPU than\\nallowed by the LimitRange.

The nice thing about the\\nerror message from the server is that it lists all the reasons why the pod was rejected,\\nnot only the first one it encountered. As you can see, the pod was rejected for two rea-\\nsons: you requested two CPUs for the container, but the maximum CPU limit for a\\ncontainer is one. Likewise, the pod as a whole requested two CPUs, but the maximum\\nis one CPU (if this was a multi-container pod, even if each individual container\\nrequested less than the maximum amount of CPU, together they’d still need to\\nrequest less than two CPUs to pass the maximum CPU for pods). \\n14.4.4 Applying default resource requests and limits\\nNow let’s also see how default resource requests and limits are set on containers that\\ndon’t specify them. Deploy the kubia-manual pod from chapter 3 again:\\n$ kubectl create -f ../Chapter03/kubia-manual.yaml\\npod \"kubia-manual\" created\\nBefore you set up your LimitRange object, all your pods were created without any\\nresource requests or limits, but now the defaults are applied automatically when creat-\\ning the pod.

It’s still possible to create many pods and eat up all the resources avail-\\nable in the cluster. LimitRanges don’t provide any protection from that. A Resource-\\nQuota object, on the other hand, does. You’ll learn about them next.\\n14.5\\nLimiting the total resources available in a namespace\\nAs you’ve seen, LimitRanges only apply to individual pods, but cluster admins also\\nneed a way to limit the total amount of resources available in a namespace. This is\\nachieved by creating a ResourceQuota object. \\n14.5.1 Introducing the ResourceQuota object\\nIn chapter 10 we said that several Admission Control plugins running inside the API\\nserver verify whether the pod may be created or not. In the previous section, I said\\nthat the LimitRanger plugin enforces the policies configured in LimitRange resources.\\nSimilarly, the ResourceQuota Admission Control plugin checks whether the pod\\nbeing created would cause the configured ResourceQuota to be exceeded. If that’s\\nthe case, the pod’s creation is rejected. Because resource quotas are enforced at pod\\ncreation time, a ResourceQuota object only affects pods created after the Resource-\\nQuota object is created—creating it has no effect on existing pods.\\n A ResourceQuota limits the amount of computational resources the pods and the\\namount of storage PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace can consume. It can also\\nlimit the number of pods, claims, and other API objects users are allowed to create\\ninside the namespace. Because you’ve mostly dealt with CPU and memory so far, let’s\\nstart by looking at how to specify quotas for them.\\nCREATING A RESOURCEQUOTA FOR CPU AND MEMORY\\nThe overall CPU and memory all the pods in a namespace are allowed to consume is\\ndefined by creating a ResourceQuota object as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ResourceQuota\\nmetadata:\\n  name: cpu-and-mem\\nspec:\\n  hard:\\n    requests.cpu: 400m\\n    requests.memory: 200Mi\\n    limits.cpu: 600m\\n    limits.memory: 500Mi\\nListing 14.13\\nA ResourceQuota resource for CPU and memory: quota-cpu-memory.yaml\\n \\n',\n",

Here, both the requests and the limits for\\nall resources are defined in a single place. \\n This ResourceQuota sets the maximum amount of CPU pods in the namespace\\ncan request to 400 millicores. The maximum total CPU limits in the namespace are\\nset to 600 millicores.

In your case, you have a LimitRange configured from the\\nprevious section, but if you didn’t have one, you couldn’t run the kubia-manual pod,\\nbecause it doesn’t specify any resource requests or limits. Here’s what would happen\\nin that case:\\n$ kubectl create -f ../Chapter03/kubia-manual.yaml\\nError from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"../Chapter03/kubia-\\nmanual.yaml\": pods \"kubia-manual\" is forbidden: failed quota: cpu-and-\\nmem: must specify limits.cpu,limits.memory,requests.cpu,requests.memory\\nWhen a quota for a specific resource (CPU or memory) is configured (request or\\nlimit), pods need to have the request or limit (respectively) set for that same resource;\\notherwise the API server will not accept the pod. That’s why having a LimitRange with\\ndefaults for those resources can make life a bit easier for people creating pods.\\n14.5.2 Specifying a quota for persistent storage\\nA ResourceQuota object can also limit the amount of persistent storage that can be\\nclaimed in the namespace, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ResourceQuota\\nmetadata:\\n  name: storage\\nspec:\\n  hard:\\n    requests.storage: 500Gi                               \\n    ssd.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage: 300Gi     \\n    standard.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage: 1Ti\\nIn this example, the amount of storage all PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace\\ncan request is limited to 500 GiB (by the requests.storage entry in the Resource-\\nQuota object).

Four scopes are\\ncurrently available: BestEffort, NotBestEffort, Terminating, and NotTerminating. \\n The BestEffort and NotBestEffort scopes determine whether the quota applies\\nto pods with the BestEffort QoS class or with one of the other two classes (that is,\\nBurstable and Guaranteed). \\n The other two scopes (Terminating and NotTerminating) don’t apply to pods\\nthat are (or aren’t) in the process of shutting down, as the name might lead you to\\nbelieve.

This property defines the number\\nof seconds a pod is allowed to be active on the node relative to its start time before it’s\\nmarked as Failed and then terminated. The Terminating quota scope applies to pods\\nthat have the activeDeadlineSeconds set, whereas the NotTerminating applies to\\nthose that don’t. \\n When creating a ResourceQuota, you can specify the scopes that it applies to.

Your pod may be running\\nfine now, but when other pods are deployed to the same node and start using the\\nCPU, your pod’s CPU time may be throttled.

Here the situation is\\nthe exact opposite. The amount of memory the pod is using is well below what was\\nrequested in the pod’s spec. The requested memory is reserved for the pod and won’t\\nbe available to other pods. The unused memory is therefore wasted. You should\\ndecrease the pod’s memory request to make the memory available to other pods run-\\nning on the node. \\n \\n',\n",

If running on a\\ncloud infrastructure, it can even spin up additional nodes if the existing ones can’t\\naccept any more pods. This chapter will explain how to get Kubernetes to do both pod\\nand node autoscaling.\\n The autoscaling feature in Kubernetes was completely rewritten between the 1.6\\nand the 1.7 version, so be aware you may find outdated information on this subject\\nonline.\\n15.1\\nHorizontal pod autoscaling\\nHorizontal pod autoscaling is the automatic scaling of the number of pod replicas man-\\naged by a controller. It’s performed by the Horizontal controller, which is enabled and\\nconfigured by creating a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) resource. The controller\\nperiodically checks pod metrics, calculates the number of replicas required to meet\\nthe target metric value configured in the HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource, and\\nadjusts the replicas field on the target resource (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication-\\nController, or StatefulSet). \\n15.1.1 Understanding the autoscaling process\\nThe autoscaling process can be split into three steps:\\n\\uf0a1Obtain metrics of all the pods managed by the scaled resource object.\\n\\uf0a1Calculate the number of pods required to bring the metrics to (or close to) the\\nspecified target value.\\n\\uf0a1Update the replicas field of the scaled resource.\\nLet’s examine all three steps next.\\nOBTAINING POD METRICS\\nThe Autoscaler doesn’t perform the gathering of the pod metrics itself. It gets the\\nmetrics from a different source. As we saw in the previous chapter, pod and node met-\\nrics are collected by an agent called cAdvisor, which runs in the Kubelet on each node,\\nand then aggregated by the cluster-wide component called Heapster. The horizontal\\npod autoscaler controller gets the metrics of all the pods by querying Heapster\\nthrough REST calls. The flow of metrics data is shown in figure 15.1 (although all the\\nconnections are initiated in the opposite direction).\\nThis implies that Heapster must be running in the cluster for autoscaling to work.

If not, make sure to enable the Heapster\\nadd-on before trying out any autoscaling examples.\\n Although you don’t need to query Heapster directly, if you’re interested in doing\\nso, you’ll find both the Heapster Pod and the Service it’s exposed through in the\\nkube-system namespace. \\nCALCULATING THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF PODS\\nOnce the Autoscaler has metrics for all the pods belonging to the resource the Auto-\\nscaler is scaling (the Deployment, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, or StatefulSet\\nresource), it can use those metrics to figure out the required number of replicas. It\\nneeds to find the number that will bring the average value of the metric across all\\nthose replicas as close to the configured target value as possible. The input to this cal-\\nculation is a set of pod metrics (possibly multiple metrics per pod) and the output is a\\nsingle integer (the number of pod replicas). \\n When the Autoscaler is configured to consider only a single metric, calculating the\\nrequired replica count is simple. All it takes is summing up the metrics values of all\\nthe pods, dividing that by the target value set on the HorizontalPodAutoscaler\\nresource, and then rounding it up to the next-larger integer. The actual calculation is\\na bit more involved than this, because it also makes sure the Autoscaler doesn’t thrash\\naround when the metric value is unstable and changes rapidly. \\n When autoscaling is based on multiple pod metrics (for example, both CPU usage\\nand Queries-Per-Second [QPS]), the calculation isn’t that much more complicated.\\nThe Autoscaler calculates the replica count for each metric individually and then\\ntakes the highest value (for example, if four pods are required to achieve the target\\nCPU usage, and three pods are required to achieve the target QPS, the Autoscaler will\\nscale to four pods). Figure 15.2 shows this example.\\nA look at changes related to how the Autoscaler obtains metrics\\nPrior to Kubernetes version 1.6, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler obtained the metrics\\nfrom Heapster directly. In version 1.8, the Autoscaler can get the metrics through an\\naggregated version of the resource metrics API by starting the Controller Manager\\nwith the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients=true flag. From ver-\\nsion 1.9, this behavior will be enabled by default.\\nThe core API server will not expose the metrics itself. From version 1.7, Kubernetes\\nallows registering multiple API servers and making them appear as a single API\\nserver. This allows it to expose metrics through one of those underlying API servers.\\nWe’ll explain API server aggregation in the last chapter. \\nSelecting what metrics collector to use in their clusters will be up to cluster adminis-\\ntrators. A simple translation layer is usually required to expose the metrics in the\\nappropriate API paths and in the appropriate format.\\n \\n',\n",

They’re shown in figure 15.4.\\nThe arrows leading from the pods to the cAdvisors, which continue on to Heapster\\nand finally to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, indicate the direction of the flow of met-\\nrics data. It’s important to be aware that each component gets the metrics from the\\nother components periodically (that is, cAdvisor gets the metrics from the pods in a\\ncontinuous loop; the same is also true for Heapster and for the HPA controller). The\\nend effect is that it takes quite a while for the metrics data to be propagated and a res-\\ncaling action to be performed. It isn’t immediate. Keep this in mind when you observe\\nthe Autoscaler in action next.\\n15.1.2 Scaling based on CPU utilization\\nPerhaps the most important metric you’ll want to base autoscaling on is the amount of\\nCPU consumed by the processes running inside your pods. Imagine having a few pods\\nproviding a service. When their CPU usage reaches 100% it’s obvious they can’t cope\\nwith the demand anymore and need to be scaled either up (vertical scaling—increas-\\ning the amount of CPU the pods can use) or out (horizontal scaling—increasing the\\nnumber of pods).

By doing that,\\nthe average CPU usage should come down. \\n Because CPU usage is usually unstable, it makes sense to scale out even before the\\nCPU is completely swamped—perhaps when the average CPU load across the pods\\nreaches or exceeds 80%. But 80% of what, exactly?\\nTIP\\nAlways set the target CPU usage well below 100% (and definitely never\\nabove 90%) to leave enough room for handling sudden load spikes.\\nAs you may remember from the previous chapter, the process running inside a con-\\ntainer is guaranteed the amount of CPU requested through the resource requests\\nspecified for the container. But at times when no other processes need CPU, the pro-\\ncess may use all the available CPU on the node. When someone says a pod is consum-\\ning 80% of the CPU, it’s not clear if they mean 80% of the node’s CPU, 80% of the\\npod’s guaranteed CPU (the resource request), or 80% of the hard limit configured\\nfor the pod through resource limits. \\n As far as the Autoscaler is concerned, only the pod’s guaranteed CPU amount (the\\nCPU requests) is important when determining the CPU utilization of a pod. The Auto-\\nscaler compares the pod’s actual CPU consumption and its CPU requests, which\\nmeans the pods you’re autoscaling need to have CPU requests set (either directly or\\nindirectly through a LimitRange object) for the Autoscaler to determine the CPU uti-\\nlization percentage.\\nCREATING A HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER BASED ON CPU USAGE\\nLet’s see how to create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler now and configure it to scale pods\\nbased on their CPU utilization. You’ll create a Deployment similar to the one in chap-\\nter 9, but as we’ve discussed, you’ll need to make sure the pods created by the Deploy-\\nment all have the CPU resource requests specified in order to make autoscaling\\npossible. You’ll have to add a CPU resource request to the Deployment’s pod tem-\\nplate, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3                \\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      name: kubia\\n      labels:\\n        app: kubia\\n    spec:\\n      containers:\\n      - image: luksa/kubia:v1     \\n        name: nodejs\\nListing 15.1\\nDeployment with CPU requests set: deployment.yaml\\nManually setting the \\n(initial) desired number \\nof replicas to three\\nRunning the \\nkubia:v1 image\\n \\n',\n",

You’re setting the target CPU utilization of the pods to 30% and specifying\\nthe minimum and maximum number of replicas. The Autoscaler will constantly keep\\nadjusting the number of replicas to keep their CPU utilization around 30%, but it will\\nnever scale down to less than one or scale up to more than five replicas. \\nTIP\\nAlways make sure to autoscale Deployments instead of the underlying\\nReplicaSets.

Even if the initial average CPU utilization was higher (say\\n150%), requiring five replicas to achieve the 30% target, the autoscaler would still\\nonly scale up to four pods in the first step, because it has a limit on how many repli-\\ncas can be added in a single scale-up operation.

If only one or two exist, it will scale up to a maximum of four replicas in a sin-\\ngle step. \\n Additionally, it has a limit on how soon a subsequent autoscale operation can\\noccur after the previous one. Currently, a scale-up will occur only if no rescaling\\nevent occurred in the last three minutes. A scale-down event is performed even less\\nfrequently—every five minutes. Keep this in mind so you don’t wonder why the\\nautoscaler refuses to perform a rescale operation even if the metrics clearly show\\nthat it should.\\nMODIFYING THE TARGET METRIC VALUE ON AN EXISTING HPA OBJECT\\nTo wrap up this section, let’s do one last exercise. Maybe your initial CPU utilization\\ntarget of 30% was a bit too low, so increase it to 60%. You do this by editing the HPA\\nresource with the kubectl edit command.

But what about autoscaling based on the pods’ memory\\nusage? \\n Memory-based autoscaling is much more problematic than CPU-based autoscal-\\ning. The main reason is because after scaling up, the old pods would somehow need to\\nbe forced to release memory. This needs to be done by the app itself—it can’t be done\\nby the system. All the system could do is kill and restart the app, hoping it would use\\nless memory than before. But if the app then uses the same amount as before, the\\nAutoscaler would scale it up again. And again, and again, until it reaches the maxi-\\nmum number of pods configured on the HPA resource. Obviously, this isn’t what any-\\none wants. Memory-based autoscaling was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.8, and\\nis configured exactly like CPU-based autoscaling. Exploring it is left up to the reader.\\n15.1.4 Scaling based on other and custom metrics\\nYou’ve seen how easy it is to scale pods based on their CPU usage. Initially, this was the\\nonly autoscaling option that was usable in practice. To have the autoscaler use custom,\\napp-defined metrics to drive its autoscaling decisions was fairly complicated. The ini-\\ntial design of the autoscaler didn’t make it easy to move beyond simple CPU-based\\nscaling. This prompted the Kubernetes Autoscaling Special Interest Group (SIG) to\\nredesign the autoscaler completely. \\n If you’re interested in learning how complicated it was to use the initial autoscaler\\nwith custom metrics, I invite you to read my blog post entitled “Kubernetes autoscal-\\ning based on custom metrics without using a host port,” which you’ll find online at\\nhttp:/\\n/medium.com/@marko.luksa. You’ll learn about all the other problems I\\nencountered when trying to set up autoscaling based on custom metrics. Luckily,\\nnewer versions of Kubernetes don’t have those problems. I’ll cover the subject in a\\nnew blog post. \\n Instead of going through a complete example here, let’s quickly go over how to\\nconfigure the autoscaler to use different metrics sources. We’ll start by examining how\\nwe defined what metric to use in our previous example.

We’ve already seen\\nhow to do that, so let’s focus on the other two types.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE PODS METRIC TYPE\\nThe Pods type is used to refer to any other (including custom) metric related to the\\npod directly. An example of such a metric could be the already mentioned Queries-\\nPer-Second (QPS) or the number of messages in a message broker’s queue (when the\\nmessage broker is running as a pod). To configure the autoscaler to use the pod’s QPS\\nmetric, the HPA object would need to include the entry shown in the following listing\\nunder its metrics field.\\n...\\nspec:\\n  metrics:\\n  - type: Pods              \\n    resource:\\n      metricName: qps             \\n      targetAverageValue: 100    \\n...\\nThe example in the listing configures the autoscaler to keep the average QPS of all\\nthe pods managed by the ReplicaSet (or other) controller targeted by this HPA\\nresource at 100. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE OBJECT METRIC TYPE\\nThe Object metric type is used when you want to make the autoscaler scale pods\\nbased on a metric that doesn’t pertain directly to those pods. For example, you may\\nwant to scale pods according to a metric of another cluster object, such as an Ingress\\nobject. The metric could be QPS as in listing 15.8, the average request latency, or\\nsomething else completely. \\n Unlike in the previous case, where the autoscaler needed to obtain the metric for\\nall targeted pods and then use the average of those values, when you use an Object\\nmetric type, the autoscaler obtains a single metric from the single object.

The target value for the metric is 20. The horizontal pod\\nautoscaler will monitor the Ingress’ metric and if it rises too far above the target value,\\nthe autoscaler will scale the kubia Deployment resource. \\n15.1.5 Determining which metrics are appropriate for autoscaling\\nYou need to understand that not all metrics are appropriate for use as the basis of\\nautoscaling. As mentioned previously, the pods’ containers’ memory consumption isn’t\\na good metric for autoscaling. The autoscaler won’t function properly if increasing\\nthe number of replicas doesn’t result in a linear decrease of the average value of the\\nobserved metric (or at least close to linear). \\n For example, if you have only a single pod instance and the value of the metric is X\\nand the autoscaler scales up to two replicas, the metric needs to fall to somewhere\\nclose to X/2. An example of such a custom metric is Queries per Second (QPS),\\nwhich in the case of web applications reports the number of requests the application\\nis receiving per second. Increasing the number of replicas will always result in a pro-\\nportionate decrease of QPS, because a greater number of pods will be handling the\\nsame total number of requests. \\n Before you decide to base the autoscaler on your app’s own custom metric, be sure\\nto think about how its value will behave when the number of pods increases or\\ndecreases.\\n15.1.6 Scaling down to zero replicas\\nThe horizontal pod autoscaler currently doesn’t allow setting the minReplicas field\\nto 0, so the autoscaler will never scale down to zero, even if the pods aren’t doing\\nListing 15.9\\nReferring to a metric of a different object in the HPA\\nUse metric of a \\nspecific object\\nThe name of \\nthe metric\\nThe specific object whose metric \\nthe autoscaler should obtain\\nThe\\nAutoscaler\\nshould\\nscale so\\nthe value\\nof the\\nmetric\\nstays close\\nto this.\\nThe scalable resource the \\nautoscaler will scale\\n \\n',\n",

When you run services that get requests only\\nonce every few hours or even days, it doesn’t make sense to have them running all the\\ntime, eating up resources that could be used by other pods. But you still want to have\\nthose services available immediately when a client request comes in. \\n This is known as idling and un-idling. It allows pods that provide a certain service\\nto be scaled down to zero. When a new request comes in, the request is blocked until\\nthe pod is brought up and then the request is finally forwarded to the pod. \\n Kubernetes currently doesn’t provide this feature yet, but it will eventually. Check\\nthe documentation to see if idling has been implemented yet. \\n15.2\\nVertical pod autoscaling\\nHorizontal scaling is great, but not every application can be scaled horizontally. For\\nsuch applications, the only option is to scale them vertically—give them more CPU\\nand/or memory. Because a node usually has more resources than a single pod\\nrequests, it should almost always be possible to scale a pod vertically, right? \\n Because a pod’s resource requests are configured through fields in the pod\\nmanifest, vertically scaling a pod would be performed by changing those fields. I\\nsay “would” because it’s currently not possible to change either resource requests\\nor limits of existing pods. Before I started writing the book (well over a year ago), I\\nwas sure that by the time I wrote this chapter, Kubernetes would already support\\nproper vertical pod autoscaling, so I included it in my proposal for the table of con-\\ntents. Sadly, what seems like a lifetime later, vertical pod autoscaling is still not\\navailable yet. \\n15.2.1 Automatically configuring resource requests\\nAn experimental feature sets the CPU and memory requests on newly created pods, if\\ntheir containers don’t have them set explicitly. The feature is provided by an Admission\\nControl plugin called InitialResources. When a new pod without resource requests is\\ncreated, the plugin looks at historical resource usage data of the pod’s containers (per\\nthe underlying container image and tag) and sets the requests accordingly. \\n You can deploy pods without specifying resource requests and rely on Kubernetes\\nto eventually figure out what each container’s resource needs are. Effectively, Kuber-\\nnetes is vertically scaling the pod. For example, if a container keeps running out of\\nmemory, the next time a pod with that container image is created, its resource request\\nfor memory will be set higher automatically.\\n15.2.2 Modifying resource requests while a pod is running\\nEventually, the same mechanism will be used to modify an existing pod’s resource\\nrequests, which means it will vertically scale the pod while it’s running.

If your Kubernetes cluster is run-\\nning on premises, you’d need to physically add a new machine and make it part of the\\nKubernetes cluster. But if your cluster is running on a cloud infrastructure, adding\\nadditional nodes is usually a matter of a few clicks or an API call to the cloud infra-\\nstructure. This can be done automatically, right?\\n Kubernetes includes the feature to automatically request additional nodes from\\nthe cloud provider as soon as it detects additional nodes are needed. This is per-\\nformed by the Cluster Autoscaler.\\n15.3.1 Introducing the Cluster Autoscaler\\nThe Cluster Autoscaler takes care of automatically provisioning additional nodes\\nwhen it notices a pod that can’t be scheduled to existing nodes because of a lack of\\nresources on those nodes. It also de-provisions nodes when they’re underutilized for\\nlonger periods of time. \\nREQUESTING ADDITIONAL NODES FROM THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE\\nA new node will be provisioned if, after a new pod is created, the Scheduler can’t\\nschedule it to any of the existing nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler looks out for such\\npods and asks the cloud provider to start up an additional node. But before doing\\nthat, it checks whether the new node can even accommodate the pod. After all, if\\nthat’s not the case, it makes no sense to start up such a node.\\n Cloud providers usually group nodes into groups (or pools) of same-sized nodes\\n(or nodes having the same features). The Cluster Autoscaler thus can’t simply say\\n“Give me an additional node.” It needs to also specify the node type.\\n The Cluster Autoscaler does this by examining the available node groups to see if\\nat least one node type would be able to fit the unscheduled pod. If exactly one such\\nnode group exists, the Autoscaler can increase the size of the node group to have the\\ncloud provider add another node to the group. If more than one option is available,\\nthe Autoscaler must pick the best one. The exact meaning of “best” will obviously\\nneed to be configurable. In the worst case, it selects a random one. A simple overview\\nof how the cluster Autoscaler reacts to an unschedulable pod is shown in figure 15.5.\\n \\n',\n",

From then on, the node is part of the\\nKubernetes cluster and pods can be scheduled to it.\\n Simple, right? What about scaling down?\\nRELINQUISHING NODES\\nThe Cluster Autoscaler also needs to scale down the number of nodes when they\\naren’t being utilized enough. The Autoscaler does this by monitoring the requested\\nCPU and memory on all the nodes. If the CPU and memory requests of all the pods\\nrunning on a given node are below 50%, the node is considered unnecessary. \\n That’s not the only determining factor in deciding whether to bring a node down.\\nThe Autoscaler also checks to see if any system pods are running (only) on that node\\n(apart from those that are run on every node, because they’re deployed by a Daemon-\\nSet, for example). If a system pod is running on a node, the node won’t be relinquished.\\nThe same is also true if an unmanaged pod or a pod with local storage is running on the\\nnode, because that would cause disruption to the service the pod is providing. In other\\nwords, a node will only be returned to the cloud provider if the Cluster Autoscaler\\nknows the pods running on the node will be rescheduled to other nodes.\\n When a node is selected to be shut down, the node is first marked as unschedula-\\nble and then all the pods running on the node are evicted.

For this reason, Kuber-\\nnetes provides a way of specifying the minimum number of pods that need to keep\\nrunning while performing these types of operations. This is done by creating a Pod-\\nDisruptionBudget resource.\\n Even though the name of the resource sounds complex, it’s one of the simplest\\nKubernetes resources available. It contains only a pod label selector and a number\\nspecifying the minimum number of pods that must always be available or, starting\\nfrom Kubernetes version 1.7, the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable.\\nWe’ll look at what a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) resource manifest looks like, but\\ninstead of creating it from a YAML file, you’ll create it with kubectl create pod-\\ndisruptionbudget and then obtain and examine the YAML later.\\n If you want to ensure three instances of your kubia pod are always running (they\\nhave the label app=kubia), create the PodDisruptionBudget resource like this:\\n$ kubectl create pdb kubia-pdb --selector=app=kubia --min-available=3\\npoddisruptionbudget \"kubia-pdb\" created\\nSimple, right?

For example, you could state that 60% of all pods with the app=kubia label need\\nto be running at all times.\\nNOTE\\nStarting with Kubernetes 1.7, the PodDisruptionBudget resource also\\nsupports the maxUnavailable field, which you can use instead of min-\\nAvailable if you want to block evictions when more than that many pods are\\nunavailable. \\nWe don’t have much more to say about this resource.

Appendix B shows\\nhow to set up a multi-node cluster with the kubeadm tool. By default, the master node\\nin such a cluster is tainted, so only Control Plane pods can be deployed on it. \\nDISPLAYING A NODE’S TAINTS\\nYou can see the node’s taints using kubectl describe node, as shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\n$ kubectl describe node master.k8s\\nName:         master.k8s\\nRole:\\nLabels:       beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\\n              beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\\n              kubernetes.io/hostname=master.k8s\\n              node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\\nAnnotations:  node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=0\\n              volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-detach=true\\nTaints:       node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule      \\n...\\nThe master node has a single taint.

The master node’s taint shown in the previous\\nlisting has the key node-role.kubernetes.io/master, a null value (not shown in the\\ntaint), and the effect of NoSchedule. \\n This taint prevents pods from being scheduled to the master node, unless those pods\\ntolerate this taint.

The Kubernetes Control Plane, when it detects that a node is no\\nlonger ready or no longer reachable, will wait for 300 seconds before it deletes the\\npod and reschedules it to another node.\\n These two tolerations are automatically added to pods that don’t define them. If\\nthat five-minute delay is too long for your pods, you can make the delay shorter by\\nadding those two tolerations to the pod’s spec.\\nNOTE\\nThis is currently an alpha feature, so it may change in future versions\\nof Kubernetes.

The node had to include all the labels speci-\\nfied in that field to be eligible to become the target for the pod. \\n Node selectors get the job done and are simple, but they don’t offer everything\\nthat you may need. Because of that, a more powerful mechanism was introduced.\\nListing 16.6\\nPod with default tolerations\\nThe pod tolerates the node being \\nnotReady for 300 seconds, before \\nit needs to be rescheduled.\\nThe same applies to the \\nnode being unreachable.\\n \\n',\n",

If that’s not possible, it will choose\\none of the other nodes. \\nEXAMINING THE DEFAULT NODE LABELS\\nNode affinity selects nodes based on their labels, the same way node selectors do.\\nBefore you see how to use node affinity, let’s examine the labels of one of the nodes in\\na Google Kubernetes Engine cluster (GKE) to see what the default node labels are.\\nThey’re shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe node gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\\nName:     gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\\nRole:\\nLabels:   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=f1-micro\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\\n          cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=default-pool\\n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=europe-west1         \\n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=europe-west1-d         \\n          kubernetes.io/hostname=gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf   \\nThe node has many labels, but the last three are the most important when it comes to\\nnode affinity and pod affinity, which you’ll learn about later. The meaning of those\\nthree labels is as follows:\\n\\uf0a1\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region specifies the geographical region\\nthe node is located in.\\n\\uf0a1\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone specifies the availability zone the\\nnode is in.\\n\\uf0a1\\nkubernetes.io/hostname is obviously the node’s hostname.\\nThese and other labels can be used in pod affinity rules. In chapter 3, you already\\nlearned how you can add a custom label to nodes and use it in a pod’s node selector.\\nYou used the custom label to deploy pods only to nodes with that label by adding a node\\nselector to the pods. Now, you’ll see how to do the same using node affinity rules.\\n16.2.1 Specifying hard node affinity rules\\nIn the example in chapter 3, you used the node selector to deploy a pod that requires\\na GPU only to nodes that have a GPU. The pod spec included the nodeSelector field\\nshown in the following listing.\\nListing 16.7\\nDefault labels of a node in GKE\\nThese three\\nlabels are the\\nmost important\\nones related to\\nnode affinity.\\n \\n',\n",

Eventu-\\nally, Kubernetes will also support RequiredDuringExecution, which means that if you\\nListing 16.8\\nA pod using a node selector: kubia-gpu-nodeselector.yaml\\nListing 16.9\\nA pod using a nodeAffinity rule: kubia-gpu-nodeaffinity.yaml\\nThis pod is only scheduled \\nto nodes that have the \\ngpu=true label.\\n \\n',\n",

Why did one of them land on node2 instead of node1? The reason is\\nthat besides the node affinity prioritization function, the Scheduler also uses other pri-\\noritization functions to decide where to schedule a pod. One of those is the Selector-\\nSpreadPriority function, which makes sure pods belonging to the same ReplicaSet or\\nService are spread around different nodes so a node failure won’t bring the whole ser-\\nvice down. That’s most likely what caused one of the pods to be scheduled to node2.\\n You can try scaling the Deployment up to 20 or more and you’ll see the majority of\\npods will be scheduled to node1. In my test, only two out of the 20 were scheduled to\\nnode2. If you hadn’t defined any node affinity preferences, the pods would have been\\nspread around the two nodes evenly.\\n16.3\\nCo-locating pods with pod affinity and anti-affinity\\nYou’ve seen how node affinity rules are used to influence which node a pod is scheduled\\nto. But these rules only affect the affinity between a pod and a node, whereas sometimes\\nyou’d like to have the ability to specify the affinity between pods themselves. \\n For example, imagine having a frontend and a backend pod. Having those pods\\ndeployed near to each other reduces latency and improves the performance of the\\napp. You could use node affinity rules to ensure both are deployed to the same node,\\nrack, or datacenter, but then you’d have to specify exactly which node, rack, or data-\\ncenter to schedule them to, which is not the best solution. It’s better to let Kubernetes\\ndeploy your pods anywhere it sees fit, while keeping the frontend and backend pods\\nclose together. This can be achieved using pod affinity. Let’s learn more about it with\\nan example.\\n16.3.1 Using inter-pod affinity to deploy pods on the same node\\nYou’ll deploy a backend pod and five frontend pod replicas with pod affinity config-\\nured so that they’re all deployed on the same node as the backend pod.\\n First, deploy the backend pod:\\n$ kubectl run backend -l app=backend --image busybox -- sleep 999999\\ndeployment \"backend\" created\\nListing 16.12\\nSeeing where pods were scheduled\\n \\n',\n",

This makes sense, because otherwise if the back-\\nend pod were to be deleted by accident and rescheduled to a different node, the fron-\\ntend pods’ affinity rules would be broken. \\n You can confirm the Scheduler takes other pods’ pod affinity rules into account, if\\nyou increase the Scheduler’s logging level and then check its log.

You probably don’t want all your frontend pods to\\nrun on the same machine, but you’d still like to keep them close to the backend\\npod—for example, run them in the same availability zone. \\nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME AVAILABILITY ZONE\\nThe cluster I’m using runs in three VMs on my local machine, so all the nodes are in\\nthe same availability zone, so to speak. But if the nodes were in different zones, all I’d\\nneed to do to run the frontend pods in the same zone as the backend pod would be to\\nchange the topologyKey property to failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone. \\nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL REGION\\nTo allow the pods to be deployed in the same region instead of the same zone (cloud\\nproviders usually have datacenters located in different geographical regions and split\\ninto multiple availability zones in each region), the topologyKey would be set to\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW TOPOLOGYKEY WORKS\\nThe way topologyKey works is simple. The three keys we’ve mentioned so far aren’t\\nspecial. If you want, you can easily use your own topologyKey, such as rack, to have\\nthe pods scheduled to the same server rack. The only prerequisite is to add a rack\\nlabel to your nodes. This scenario is shown in figure 16.5.\\n For example, if you had 20 nodes, with 10 in each rack, you’d label the first ten as\\nrack=rack1 and the others as rack=rack2. Then, when defining a pod’s podAffinity,\\nyou’d set the toplogyKey to rack. \\n When the Scheduler is deciding where to deploy a pod, it checks the pod’s pod-\\nAffinity config, finds the pods that match the label selector, and looks up the nodes\\nthey’re running on. Specifically, it looks up the nodes’ label whose key matches the\\ntopologyKey field specified in podAffinity. Then it selects all the nodes whose label\\n \\n',\n",

The value of the rack label on\\nthat node equals rack2, so when scheduling a frontend pod, the Scheduler will only\\nselect among the nodes that have the rack=rack2 label.\\nNOTE\\nBy default, the label selector only matches pods in the same name-\\nspace as the pod that’s being scheduled. But you can also select pods from\\nother namespaces by adding a namespaces field at the same level as label-\\nSelector.\\n16.3.3 Expressing pod affinity preferences instead of hard requirements\\nEarlier, when we talked about node affinity, you saw that nodeAffinity can be used to\\nexpress a hard requirement, which means a pod is only scheduled to nodes that match\\nthe node affinity rules. It can also be used to specify node preferences, to instruct the\\nScheduler to schedule the pod to certain nodes, while allowing it to schedule it any-\\nwhere else if those nodes can’t fit the pod for any reason.\\n The same also applies to podAffinity. You can tell the Scheduler you’d prefer to\\nhave your frontend pods scheduled onto the same node as your backend pod, but if\\nthat’s not possible, you’re okay with them being scheduled elsewhere. An example of\\na Deployment using the preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution pod\\naffinity rule is shown in the next listing.\\nFrontend pods will be\\nscheduled to nodes in\\nthe same rack as the\\nbackend pod.\\nNode 1\\nRack 1\\nrack: rack1\\nNode 2\\nrack: rack1\\nNode 3\\n...\\nrack: rack1\\nNode 10\\nrack: rack1\\nNode 11\\nRack 2\\nrack: rack2\\nNode 12\\nrack: rack2\\n...\\nNode 20\\nrack: rack2\\nBackend\\npod\\napp: backend\\nFrontend pods\\nPod afﬁnity (required)\\nLabel selector: app=backend\\nTopology key: rack\\nFigure 16.5\\nThe topologyKey in podAffinity determines the scope of where the pod \\nshould be scheduled to.\\n \\n',\n",

You may want to keep pods away from each other. This is called\\npod anti-affinity. It’s specified the same way as pod affinity, except that you use the\\npodAntiAffinity property instead of podAffinity, which results in the Scheduler\\nnever choosing nodes where pods matching the podAntiAffinity’s label selector are\\nrunning, as shown in figure 16.7.\\nAn example of why you’d want to use pod anti-affinity is when two sets of pods inter-\\nfere with each other’s performance if they run on the same node. In that case, you\\nwant to tell the Scheduler to never schedule those pods on the same node. Another\\nexample would be to force the Scheduler to spread pods of the same group across dif-\\nferent availability zones or regions, so that a failure of a whole zone (or region) never\\nbrings the service down completely. \\nListing 16.17\\nPods deployed with podAffinity preferences\\nThese pods will NOT be scheduled\\nto the same node(s) where pods\\nwith app=foo label are running.\\nSome node\\nOther nodes\\nPods\\nPod: foo\\nPod\\n(required)\\nanti-afﬁnity\\nLabel selector: app=foo\\nTopology key: hostname\\napp: foo\\nFigure 16.7\\nUsing pod anti-affinity to keep pods away from nodes that run pods \\nwith a certain label.\\n \\n',\n",

Figure 17.1 shows the Kubernetes components used in a typical application.\\nA typical application manifest contains one or more Deployment and/or StatefulSet\\nobjects. Those include a pod template containing one or more containers, with a live-\\nness probe for each of them and a readiness probe for the service(s) the container\\nprovides (if any).

Cer-\\ntain pods use additional volumes, such as an emptyDir or a gitRepo volume, whereas\\npods requiring persistent storage use persistentVolumeClaim volumes. The Persistent-\\nVolumeClaims are also part of the application manifest, whereas StorageClasses refer-\\nenced by them are created by system administrators upfront. \\n In certain cases, an application also requires the use of Jobs or CronJobs. Daemon-\\nSets aren’t normally part of application deployments, but are usually created by sysad-\\nmins to run system services on all or a subset of nodes. HorizontalPodAutoscalers\\nare either included in the manifest by the developers or added to the system later by\\nthe ops team. The cluster administrator also creates LimitRange and ResourceQuota\\nobjects to keep compute resource usage of individual pods and all the pods (as a\\nwhole) under control.\\n After the application is deployed, additional objects are created automatically by\\nthe various Kubernetes controllers. These include service Endpoints objects created\\nby the Endpoints controller, ReplicaSets created by the Deployment controller, and\\nthe actual pods created by the ReplicaSet (or Job, CronJob, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet)\\ncontrollers.\\n Resources are often labeled with one or more labels to keep them organized. This\\ndoesn’t apply only to pods but to all other resources as well. In addition to labels, most\\nresources also contain annotations that describe each resource, list the contact infor-\\nmation of the person or team responsible for it, or provide additional metadata for\\nmanagement and other tools. \\n At the center of all this is the Pod, which arguably is the most important Kuberne-\\ntes resource. After all, each of your applications runs inside it. To make sure you know\\nhow to develop apps that make the most out of their environment, let’s take one last\\nclose look at pods—this time from the application’s perspective. \\n17.2\\nUnderstanding the pod’s lifecycle\\nWe’ve said that pods can be compared to VMs dedicated to running only a single\\napplication. Although an application running inside a pod is not unlike an application\\nrunning in a VM, significant differences do exist. One example is that apps running in\\na pod can be killed any time, because Kubernetes needs to relocate the pod to\\nanother node for a reason or because of a scale-down request. We’ll explore this\\naspect next.\\n17.2.1 Applications must expect to be killed and relocated\\nOutside Kubernetes, apps running in VMs are seldom moved from one machine to\\nanother. When an operator moves the app, they can also reconfigure the app and\\nmanually check that the app is running fine in the new location. With Kubernetes,\\napps are relocated much more frequently and automatically—no human operator\\n \\n',\n",

This means\\napplication developers need to make sure their apps allow being moved relatively\\noften. \\nEXPECTING THE LOCAL IP AND HOSTNAME TO CHANGE\\nWhen a pod is killed and run elsewhere (technically, it’s a new pod instance replac-\\ning the old one; the pod isn’t relocated), it not only has a new IP address but also a\\nnew name and hostname. Most stateless apps can usually handle this without any\\nadverse effects, but stateful apps usually can’t. We’ve learned that stateful apps can\\nbe run through a StatefulSet, which ensures that when the app starts up on a new\\nnode after being rescheduled, it will still see the same host name and persistent state\\nas before. The pod’s IP will change nevertheless. Apps need to be prepared for that\\nto happen. The application developer therefore should never base membership in a\\nclustered app on the member’s IP address, and if basing it on the hostname, should\\nalways use a StatefulSet.\\nEXPECTING THE DATA WRITTEN TO DISK TO DISAPPEAR\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that if the app writes data to disk, that data may not be\\navailable after the app is started inside a new pod, unless you mount persistent storage at\\nthe location the app is writing to. It should be clear this happens when the pod is\\nrescheduled, but files written to disk will disappear even in scenarios that don’t involve\\nany rescheduling. Even during the lifetime of a single pod, the files written to disk by\\nthe app running in the pod may disappear. Let me explain this with an example.\\n Imagine an app that has a long and computationally intensive initial startup proce-\\ndure. To help the app come up faster on subsequent startups, the developers make\\nthe app cache the results of the initial startup on disk (an example of this would be\\nthe scanning of all Java classes for annotations at startup and then writing the results\\nto an index file). Because apps in Kubernetes run in containers by default, these files\\nare written to the container’s filesystem. If the container is then restarted, they’re all\\nlost, because the new container starts off with a completely new writable layer (see fig-\\nure 17.2).\\n Don’t forget that individual containers may be restarted for several reasons, such\\nas because the process crashes, because the liveness probe returned a failure, or\\nbecause the node started running out of memory and the process was killed by the\\nOOMKiller. When this happens, the pod is still the same, but the container itself is\\ncompletely new. The Kubelet doesn’t run the same container again; it always creates a\\nnew container. \\nUSING VOLUMES TO PRESERVE DATA ACROSS CONTAINER RESTARTS\\nWhen its container is restarted, the app in the example will need to perform the\\nintensive startup procedure again. This may or may not be desired. To make sure data\\nlike this isn’t lost, you need to use at least a pod-scoped volume. Because volumes live\\nand die together with the pod, the new container will be able to reuse the data written\\nto the volume by the previous container (figure 17.3).\\n \\n',\n",

What if the data gets corrupted and causes the newly created process\\nto crash again? This will result in a continuous crash loop (the pod will show the\\nCrashLoopBackOff status). If you hadn’t used a volume, the new container would start\\nfrom scratch and most likely not crash. Using volumes to preserve files across con-\\ntainer restarts like this is a double-edged sword. You need to think carefully about\\nwhether to use them or not.\\n17.2.2 Rescheduling of dead or partially dead pods\\nIf a pod’s container keeps crashing, the Kubelet will keep restarting it indefinitely.\\nThe time between restarts will be increased exponentially until it reaches five minutes.\\nDuring those five minute intervals, the pod is essentially dead, because its container’s\\nprocess isn’t running. To be fair, if it’s a multi-container pod, certain containers may\\nbe running normally, so the pod is only partially dead. But if a pod contains only a sin-\\ngle container, the pod is effectively dead and completely useless, because no process is\\nrunning in it anymore.\\n You may find it surprising to learn that such pods aren’t automatically removed\\nand rescheduled, even if they’re part of a ReplicaSet or similar controller. If you cre-\\nate a ReplicaSet with a desired replica count of three, and then one of the containers\\nin one of those pods starts crashing, Kubernetes will not delete and replace the pod.\\nThe end result is a ReplicaSet with only two properly running replicas instead of the\\ndesired three (figure 17.4).\\nYou’d probably expect the pod to be deleted and replaced with another pod instance\\nthat might run successfully on another node.

You have\\nno guarantee that pods will also be started in that order. \\n But you can prevent a pod’s main container from starting until a precondition is\\nmet. This is done by including an init containers in the pod. \\nINTRODUCING INIT CONTAINERS\\nIn addition to regular containers, pods can also include init containers. As the name\\nsuggests, they can be used to initialize the pod—this often means writing data to the\\npod’s volumes, which are then mounted into the pod’s main container(s).\\n A pod may have any number of init containers. They’re executed sequentially and\\nonly after the last one completes are the pod’s main containers started. This means\\ninit containers can also be used to delay the start of the pod’s main container(s)—for\\nexample, until a certain precondition is met. An init container could wait for a service\\nrequired by the pod’s main container to be up and ready. When it is, the init container\\nterminates and allows the main container(s) to be started. This way, the main con-\\ntainer wouldn’t use the service before it’s ready.\\n Let’s look at an example of a pod using an init container to delay the start of the\\nmain container. Remember the fortune pod you created in chapter 7? It’s a web\\nserver that returns a fortune quote as a response to client requests. Now, let’s imagine\\nyou have a fortune-client pod that requires the fortune Service to be up and run-\\nning before its main container starts. You can add an init container, which checks\\nwhether the Service is responding to requests. Until that’s the case, the init container\\nkeeps retrying. Once it gets a response, the init container terminates and lets the main\\ncontainer start.\\nADDING AN INIT CONTAINER TO A POD\\nInit containers can be defined in the pod spec like main containers but through the\\nspec.initContainers field. You’ll find the complete YAML for the fortune-client pod\\nin the book’s code archive. The following listing shows the part where the init con-\\ntainer is defined.\\nspec:\\n  initContainers:      \\n  - name: init\\n    image: busybox\\n    command:\\n    - sh\\n    - -c\\n    - \\'while true; do echo \"Waiting for fortune service to come up...\";  \\n    ➥ wget http://fortune -q -T 1 -O /dev/null >/dev/null 2>/dev/null   \\n    ➥ && break; sleep 1; done; echo \"Service is up!

You can see\\nthe log of the init container with kubectl logs:\\n$ kubectl logs fortune-client -c init\\nWaiting for fortune service to come up...\\nWhen running the kubectl logs command, you need to specify the name of the init\\ncontainer with the -c switch (in the example, the name of the pod’s init container is\\ninit, as you can see in listing 17.2).\\n The main container won’t run until you deploy the fortune Service and the\\nfortune-server pod. You’ll find them in the fortune-server.yaml file. \\nBEST PRACTICES FOR HANDLING INTER-POD DEPENDENCIES\\nYou’ve seen how an init container can be used to delay starting the pod’s main con-\\ntainer(s) until a precondition is met (making sure the Service the pod depends on is\\nready, for example), but it’s much better to write apps that don’t require every service\\nthey rely on to be ready before the app starts up. After all, the service may also go\\noffline later, while the app is already running.\\n The application needs to handle internally the possibility that its dependencies\\naren’t ready. And don’t forget readiness probes. If an app can’t do its job because one\\nof its dependencies is missing, it should signal that through its readiness probe, so\\nKubernetes knows it, too, isn’t ready. You’ll want to do this not only because it pre-\\nvents the app from being added as a service endpoint, but also because the app’s read-\\niness is also used by the Deployment controller when performing a rolling update,\\nthereby preventing a rollout of a bad version. \\n17.2.4 Adding lifecycle hooks\\nWe’ve talked about how init containers can be used to hook into the startup of the\\npod, but pods also allow you to define two lifecycle hooks:\\n\\uf0a1Post-start hooks\\n\\uf0a1Pre-stop hooks\\nThese lifecycle hooks are specified per container, unlike init containers, which apply\\nto the whole pod.

Sure, if you’re\\nthe author of the application running in the container, you can always perform those\\noperations inside the application code itself. But when you’re running an application\\ndeveloped by someone else, you mostly don’t want to (or can’t) modify its source\\ncode. Post-start hooks allow you to run additional commands without having to touch\\nthe app. These may signal to an external listener that the app is starting, or they may\\ninitialize the application so it can start doing its job.\\n The hook is run in parallel with the main process. The name might be somewhat\\nmisleading, because it doesn’t wait for the main process to start up fully (if the process\\nhas an initialization procedure, the Kubelet obviously can’t wait for the procedure to\\ncomplete, because it has no way of knowing when that is). \\n But even though the hook runs asynchronously, it does affect the container in two\\nways. Until the hook completes, the container will stay in the Waiting state with the\\nreason ContainerCreating. Because of this, the pod’s status will be Pending instead of\\nRunning. If the hook fails to run or returns a non-zero exit code, the main container\\nwill be killed. \\n A pod manifest containing a post-start hook looks like the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-with-poststart-hook\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: luksa/kubia\\n    name: kubia\\n    lifecycle:          \\n      postStart:        \\n        exec:                                                               \\n          command:                                                          \\n          - sh                                                              \\n          - -c                                                              \\n          - \"echo \\'hook will fail with exit code 15\\'; sleep 5; exit 15\"     \\nIn the example, the echo, sleep, and exit commands are executed along with the\\ncontainer’s main process as soon as the container is created. Rather than run a com-\\nmand like this, you’d typically run a shell script or a binary executable file stored in\\nthe container image. \\n Sadly, if the process started by the hook logs to the standard output, you can’t see\\nthe output anywhere.

The\\nfollowing listing shows how to define a pre-stop HTTP GET hook in a pod.\\n    lifecycle:\\n      preStop:            \\n        httpGet:          \\n          port: 8080          \\n          path: shutdown      \\nThe pre-stop hook defined in this listing performs an HTTP GET request to http:/\\n/\\nPOD_IP:8080/shutdown as soon as the Kubelet starts terminating the container.\\nApart from the port and path shown in the listing, you can also set the fields scheme\\n(HTTP or HTTPS) and host, as well as httpHeaders that should be sent in the\\nrequest. The host field defaults to the pod IP. Be sure not to set it to localhost,\\nbecause localhost would refer to the node, not the pod.\\n In contrast to the post-start hook, the container will be terminated regardless of\\nthe result of the hook—an error HTTP response code or a non-zero exit code when\\nusing a command-based hook will not prevent the container from being terminated.\\nIf the pre-stop hook fails, you’ll see a FailedPreStopHook warning event among the\\npod’s events, but because the pod is deleted soon afterward (after all, the pod’s dele-\\ntion is what triggered the pre-stop hook in the first place), you may not even notice\\nthat the pre-stop hook failed to run properly. \\nTIP\\nIf the successful completion of the pre-stop hook is critical to the proper\\noperation of your system, verify whether it’s being executed at all. I’ve wit-\\nnessed situations where the pre-stop hook didn’t run and the developer\\nwasn’t even aware of that.\\nUSING A PRE-STOP HOOK BECAUSE YOUR APP DOESN’T RECEIVE THE SIGTERM SIGNAL\\nMany developers make the mistake of defining a pre-stop hook solely to send a SIGTERM\\nsignal to their apps in the pre-stop hook. They do this because they don’t see their appli-\\ncation receive the SIGTERM signal sent by the Kubelet. The reason why the signal isn’t\\nreceived by the application isn’t because Kubernetes isn’t sending it, but because the sig-\\nnal isn’t being passed to the app process inside the container itself. If your container\\nimage is configured to run a shell, which in turn runs the app process, the signal may be\\neaten up by the shell itself, instead of being passed down to the child process.\\n In such cases, instead of adding a pre-stop hook to send the signal directly to your\\napp, the proper fix is to make sure the shell passes the signal to the app. This can be\\nachieved by handling the signal in the shell script running as the main container pro-\\ncess and then passing it on to the app. Or you could not configure the container image\\nto run a shell at all and instead run the application binary directly. You do this by using\\nthe exec form of ENTRYPOINT or CMD in the Dockerfile: ENTRYPOINT [\"/mybinary\"]\\ninstead of ENTRYPOINT /mybinary.\\nListing 17.6\\nA pre-stop hook YAML snippet: pre-stop-hook-httpget.yaml\\nThis is a pre-stop hook that \\nperforms an HTTP GET request.\\nThe request is sent to \\nhttp://POD_IP:8080/shutdown.\\n \\n',\n",

You shouldn’t use a pre-stop hook for run-\\nning actions that need to be performed when the pod is terminating. The reason is\\nthat the pre-stop hook gets called when the container is being terminated (most likely\\nbecause of a failed liveness probe). This may happen multiple times in the pod’s life-\\ntime, not only when the pod is in the process of being shut down. \\n17.2.5 Understanding pod shutdown\\nWe’ve touched on the subject of pod termination, so let’s explore this subject in more\\ndetail and go over exactly what happens during pod shutdown. This is important for\\nunderstanding how to cleanly shut down an application running in a pod.\\n Let’s start at the beginning. A pod’s shut-down is triggered by the deletion of the\\nPod object through the API server. Upon receiving an HTTP DELETE request, the\\nAPI server doesn’t delete the object yet, but only sets a deletionTimestamp field in it.\\nPods that have the deletionTimestamp field set are terminating. \\n Once the Kubelet notices the pod needs to be terminated, it starts terminating\\neach of the pod’s containers. It gives each container time to shut down gracefully, but\\nthe time is limited. That time is called the termination grace period and is configu-\\nrable per pod. The timer starts as soon as the termination process starts. Then the fol-\\nlowing sequence of events is performed:\\n1\\nRun the pre-stop hook, if one is configured, and wait for it to finish.\\n2\\nSend the SIGTERM signal to the main process of the container.\\n3\\nWait until the container shuts down cleanly or until the termination grace\\nperiod runs out.\\n4\\nForcibly kill the process with SIGKILL, if it hasn’t terminated gracefully yet.\\nThe sequence of events is illustrated in figure 17.5.\\nPre-stop hook process\\nTermination grace period\\nMain container process\\nContainer shutdown\\ninitiated\\nContainer killed\\nif still running\\nTime\\nSIGTERM\\nSIGKILL\\nFigure 17.5\\nThe container termination sequence\\n \\n',\n",

It defaults to 30, which means the pod’s con-\\ntainers will be given 30 seconds to terminate gracefully before they’re killed forcibly. \\nTIP\\nYou should set the grace period to long enough so your process can fin-\\nish cleaning up in that time. \\nThe grace period specified in the pod spec can also be overridden when deleting the\\npod like this:\\n$ kubectl delete po mypod --grace-period=5\\nThis will make the Kubelet wait five seconds for the pod to shut down cleanly. When\\nall the pod’s containers stop, the Kubelet notifies the API server and the Pod resource\\nis finally deleted. You can force the API server to delete the resource immediately,\\nwithout waiting for confirmation, by setting the grace period to zero and adding the\\n--force option like this:\\n$ kubectl delete po mypod --grace-period=0 --force\\nBe careful when using this option, especially with pods of a StatefulSet. The Stateful-\\nSet controller takes great care to never run two instances of the same pod at the same\\ntime (two pods with the same ordinal index and name and attached to the same\\nPersistentVolume). By force-deleting a pod, you’ll cause the controller to create a\\nreplacement pod without waiting for the containers of the deleted pod to shut\\ndown. In other words, two instances of the same pod might be running at the same\\ntime, which may cause your stateful cluster to malfunction. Only delete stateful pods\\nforcibly when you’re absolutely sure the pod isn’t running anymore or can’t talk to\\nthe other members of the cluster (you can be sure of this when you confirm that the\\nnode that hosted the pod has failed or has been disconnected from the network and\\ncan’t reconnect). \\n Now that you understand how containers are shut down, let’s look at it from the\\napplication’s perspective and go over how applications should handle the shutdown\\nprocedure.\\nIMPLEMENTING THE PROPER SHUTDOWN HANDLER IN YOUR APPLICATION\\nApplications should react to a SIGTERM signal by starting their shut-down procedure\\nand terminating when it finishes. Instead of handling the SIGTERM signal, the applica-\\ntion can be notified to shut down through a pre-stop hook. In both cases, the app\\nthen only has a fixed amount of time to terminate cleanly. \\n But what if you can’t predict how long the app will take to shut down cleanly? For\\nexample, imagine your app is a distributed data store. On scale-down, one of the pod\\ninstances will be deleted and therefore shut down. In the shut-down procedure, the\\n \\n',\n",

This is not recommended for at least the following two reasons:\\n\\uf0a1A container terminating doesn’t necessarily mean the whole pod is being\\nterminated.\\n\\uf0a1You have no guarantee the shut-down procedure will finish before the process\\nis killed.\\nThis second scenario doesn’t happen only when the grace period runs out before the\\napplication has finished shutting down gracefully, but also when the node running\\nthe pod fails in the middle of the container shut-down sequence. Even if the node\\nthen starts up again, the Kubelet will not restart the shut-down procedure (it won’t\\neven start up the container again). There are absolutely no guarantees that the pod\\nwill be allowed to complete its whole shut-down procedure.\\nREPLACING CRITICAL SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURES WITH DEDICATED SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURE PODS\\nHow do you ensure that a critical shut-down procedure that absolutely must run to\\ncompletion does run to completion (for example, to ensure that a pod’s data is\\nmigrated to other pods)?\\n One solution is for the app (upon receipt of a termination signal) to create a new\\nJob resource that would run a new pod, whose sole job is to migrate the deleted pod’s\\ndata to the remaining pods. But if you’ve been paying attention, you’ll know that you\\nhave no guarantee the app will indeed manage to create the Job object every single\\ntime. What if the node fails exactly when the app tries to do that? \\n The proper way to handle this problem is by having a dedicated, constantly run-\\nning pod that keeps checking for the existence of orphaned data. When this pod finds\\nthe orphaned data, it can migrate it to the remaining pods. Rather than a constantly\\nrunning pod, you can also use a CronJob resource and run the pod periodically. \\n You may think StatefulSets could help here, but they don’t. As you’ll remember,\\nscaling down a StatefulSet leaves PersistentVolumeClaims orphaned, leaving the data\\nstored on the PersistentVolume stranded. Yes, upon a subsequent scale-up, the Persistent-\\nVolume will be reattached to the new pod instance, but what if that scale-up never\\nhappens (or happens after a long time)? For this reason, you may want to run a\\ndata-migrating pod also when using StatefulSets (this scenario is shown in figure 17.6).\\nTo prevent the migration from occurring during an application upgrade, the data-\\nmigrating pod could be configured to wait a while to give the stateful pod time to\\ncome up again before performing the migration.\\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Now, we’ll look at\\nthe pod’s lifecycle from the perspective of the pod’s clients (clients consuming the ser-\\nvice the pod is providing). This is important to understand if you don’t want clients to\\nrun into problems when you scale pods up or down.\\n It goes without saying that you want all client requests to be handled properly. You\\nobviously don’t want to see broken connections when pods are starting up or shutting\\ndown. By itself, Kubernetes doesn’t prevent this from happening. Your app needs to\\nfollow a few rules to prevent broken connections. First, let’s focus on making sure all\\nconnections are handled properly when the pod starts up.\\n17.3.1 Preventing broken client connections when a pod is starting up\\nEnsuring each connection is handled properly at pod startup is simple if you under-\\nstand how Services and service Endpoints work. When a pod is started, it’s added as an\\nendpoint to all the Services, whose label selector matches the pod’s labels. As you may\\nremember from chapter 5, the pod also needs to signal to Kubernetes that it’s ready.\\nUntil it is, it won’t become a service endpoint and therefore won’t receive any requests\\nfrom clients. \\n If you don’t specify a readiness probe in your pod spec, the pod is always considered\\nready. It will start receiving requests almost immediately—as soon as the first kube-proxy\\nupdates the iptables rules on its node and the first client pod tries to connect to the\\nservice. If your app isn’t ready to accept connections by then, clients will see “connec-\\ntion refused” types of errors.\\n All you need to do is make sure that your readiness probe returns success only\\nwhen your app is ready to properly handle incoming requests. A good first step is to\\nadd an HTTP GET readiness probe and point it to the base URL of your app. In many\\nPod\\nA-0\\nPod\\nA-1\\nStatefulSet A\\nReplicas: 2\\nScale\\ndown\\nPVC\\nA-0\\nPV\\nPVC\\nA-1\\nPV\\nPod\\nA-0\\nStatefulSet A\\nReplicas: 1\\nTransfers data to\\nremaining pod(s)\\nConnects to\\norphaned PVC\\nData-migrating\\nPod\\nJob\\nPVC\\nA-0\\nPV\\nPVC\\nA-1\\nPV\\nFigure 17.6\\nUsing a dedicated pod to migrate data \\n \\n',\n",

We’ve already talked about how the pod’s containers\\nshould start shutting down cleanly as soon they receive the SIGTERM signal (or when its\\npre-stop hook is executed). But does that ensure all client requests are handled properly? \\n How should the app behave when it receives a termination signal? Should it con-\\ntinue to accept requests? What about requests that have already been received but\\nhaven’t completed yet? What about persistent HTTP connections, which may be in\\nbetween requests, but are open (when no active request exists on the connection)?\\nBefore we can answer those questions, we need to take a detailed look at the chain of\\nevents that unfolds across the cluster when a Pod is deleted. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OCCURRING AT POD DELETION\\nIn chapter 11 we took an in-depth look at what components make up a Kubernetes clus-\\nter. You need to always keep in mind that those components run as separate processes on\\nmultiple machines. They aren’t all part of a single big monolithic process. It takes time\\nfor all the components to be on the same page regarding the state of the cluster. Let’s\\nexplore this fact by looking at what happens across the cluster when a Pod is deleted.\\n When a request for a pod deletion is received by the API server, it first modifies the\\nstate in etcd and then notifies its watchers of the deletion. Among those watchers are\\nthe Kubelet and the Endpoints controller. The two sequences of events, which happen\\nin parallel (marked with either A or B), are shown in figure 17.7.\\nA2.

       "  'text': '494\\nCHAPTER 17\\nBest practices for developing apps\\nIn the A sequence of events, you’ll see that as soon as the Kubelet receives the notifica-\\ntion that the pod should be terminated, it initiates the shutdown sequence as explained\\nin section 17.2.5 (run the pre-stop hook, send SIGTERM, wait for a period of time, and\\nthen forcibly kill the container if it hasn’t yet terminated on its own). If the app\\nresponds to the SIGTERM by immediately ceasing to receive client requests, any client\\ntrying to connect to it will receive a Connection Refused error. The time it takes for\\nthis to happen from the time the pod is deleted is relatively short because of the direct\\npath from the API server to the Kubelet.\\n Now, let’s look at what happens in the other sequence of events—the one leading\\nup to the pod being removed from the iptables rules (sequence B in the figure).\\nWhen the Endpoints controller (which runs in the Controller Manager in the Kuber-\\nnetes Control Plane) receives the notification of the Pod being deleted, it removes\\nthe pod as an endpoint in all services that the pod is a part of. It does this by modify-\\ning the Endpoints API object by sending a REST request to the API server. The API\\nserver then notifies all clients watching the Endpoints object. Among those watchers\\nare all the kube-proxies running on the worker nodes. Each of these proxies then\\nupdates the iptables rules on its node, which is what prevents new connections\\nfrom being forwarded to the terminating pod. An important detail here is that\\nremoving the iptables rules has no effect on existing connections—clients who are\\nalready connected to the pod will still send additional requests to the pod through\\nthose existing connections.\\n Both of these sequences of events happen in parallel. Most likely, the time it takes\\nto shut down the app’s process in the pod is slightly shorter than the time required for\\nthe iptables rules to be updated. The chain of events that leads to iptables rules\\nbeing updated is considerably longer (see figure 17.8), because the event must first\\nreach the Endpoints controller, which then sends a new request to the API server, and\\nA2.

A high probability exists that the SIGTERM signal will be sent well\\nbefore the iptables rules are updated on all nodes.\\n The end result is that the pod may still receive client requests after it was sent the\\ntermination signal. If the app closes the server socket and stops accepting connections\\nimmediately, this will cause clients to receive “Connection Refused” types of errors\\n(similar to what happens at pod startup if your app isn’t capable of accepting connec-\\ntions immediately and you don’t define a readiness probe for it). \\nSOLVING THE PROBLEM\\nGoogling solutions to this problem makes it seem as though adding a readiness probe\\nto your pod will solve the problem. Supposedly, all you need to do is make the readi-\\nness probe start failing as soon as the pod receives the SIGTERM. This is supposed to\\ncause the pod to be removed as the endpoint of the service. But the removal would\\nhappen only after the readiness probe fails for a few consecutive times (this is configu-\\nrable in the readiness probe spec). And, obviously, the removal then still needs to\\nreach the kube-proxy before the pod is removed from iptables rules. \\n In reality, the readiness probe has absolutely no bearing on the whole process at\\nall. The Endpoints controller removes the pod from the service Endpoints as soon as\\nit receives notice of the pod being deleted (when the deletionTimestamp field in the\\npod’s spec is no longer null). From that point on, the result of the readiness probe\\nis irrelevant.\\n What’s the proper solution to the problem? How can you make sure all requests\\nare handled fully?\\n It’s clear the pod needs to keep accepting connections even after it receives the ter-\\nmination signal up until all the kube-proxies have finished updating the iptables\\nrules. Well, it’s not only the kube-proxies. There may also be Ingress controllers or\\nload balancers forwarding connections to the pod directly, without going through the\\nService (iptables). This also includes clients using client-side load-balancing. To\\nensure none of the clients experience broken connections, you’d have to wait until all\\nof them somehow notify you they’ll no longer forward connections to the pod. \\n That’s impossible, because all those components are distributed across many dif-\\nferent computers. Even if you knew the location of every one of them and could wait\\nuntil all of them say it’s okay to shut down the pod, what do you do if one of them\\ndoesn’t respond? How long do you wait for the response? Remember, during that\\ntime, you’re holding up the shut-down process. \\n The only reasonable thing you can do is wait for a long-enough time to ensure all\\nthe proxies have done their job. But how long is long enough? A few seconds should\\nbe enough in most situations, but there’s no guarantee it will suffice every time. When\\nthe API server or the Endpoints controller is overloaded, it may take longer for the\\nnotification to reach the kube-proxy. It’s important to understand that you can’t solve\\nthe problem perfectly, but even adding a 5- or 10-second delay should improve the\\nuser experience considerably. You can use a longer delay, but don’t go overboard,\\n \\n',\n",

Keep in mind that if you use mutable tags\\n(you push changes to the same tag), you’ll need to set the imagePullPolicy field in\\nthe pod spec to Always. But if you use that in production pods, be aware of the big\\ncaveat associated with it. If the image pull policy is set to Always, the container run-\\ntime will contact the image registry every time a new pod is deployed. This slows\\ndown pod startup a bit, because the node needs to check if the image has been mod-\\nified. Worse yet, this policy prevents the pod from starting up when the registry can-\\nnot be contacted.\\n17.4.3 Using multi-dimensional instead of single-dimensional labels\\nDon’t forget to label all your resources, not only Pods. Make sure you add multiple\\nlabels to each resource, so they can be selected across each individual dimension. You\\n(or the ops team) will be grateful you did it when the number of resources increases.\\n Labels may include things like\\n\\uf0a1The name of the application (or perhaps microservice) the resource belongs to\\n\\uf0a1Application tier (front-end, back-end, and so on)\\n\\uf0a1Environment (development, QA, staging, production, and so on)\\n\\uf0a1Version\\n\\uf0a1Type of release (stable, canary, green or blue for green/blue deployments, and\\nso on)\\n\\uf0a1Tenant (if you’re running separate pods for each tenant instead of using name-\\nspaces)\\n\\uf0a1Shard for sharded systems\\nThis will allow you to manage resources in groups instead of individually and make it\\neasy to see where each resource belongs.\\n17.4.4 Describing each resource through annotations\\nTo add additional information to your resources use annotations. At the least,\\nresources should contain an annotation describing the resource and an annotation\\nwith contact information of the person responsible for it. \\n In a microservices architecture, pods could contain an annotation that lists the\\nnames of the other services the pod is using. This makes it possible to show dependen-\\ncies between pods. Other annotations could include build and version information\\nand metadata used by tooling or graphical user interfaces (icon names, and so on).\\n Both labels and annotations make managing running applications much easier, but\\nnothing is worse than when an application starts crashing and you don’t know why.\\n17.4.5 Providing information on why the process terminated\\nNothing is more frustrating than having to figure out why a container terminated\\n(or is even terminating continuously), especially if it happens at the worst possible\\n \\n',\n",

The contents of this file are read by the Kubelet when the con-\\ntainer terminates and are shown in the output of kubectl describe pod. If an applica-\\ntion uses this mechanism, an operator can quickly see why the app terminated without\\neven having to look at the container logs. \\n The default file the process needs to write the message to is /dev/termination-log,\\nbut it can be changed by setting the terminationMessagePath field in the container\\ndefinition in the pod spec. \\n You can see this in action by running a pod whose container dies immediately, as\\nshown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-with-termination-message\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: busybox\\n    name: main\\n    terminationMessagePath: /var/termination-reason         \\n    command:\\n    - sh\\n    - -c\\n    - \\'echo \"I\\'\\'ve had enough\" > /var/termination-reason ; exit 1\\'   \\nWhen running this pod, you’ll soon see the pod’s status shown as CrashLoopBackOff.\\nIf you then use kubectl describe, you can see why the container died, without having\\nto dig down into its logs, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe po\\nName:           pod-with-termination-message\\n...\\nContainers:\\n...\\n    State:      Waiting\\n      Reason:   CrashLoopBackOff\\n    Last State: Terminated\\n      Reason:   Error\\n      Message:  I\\'ve had enough          \\n      Exit Code:        1\\n      Started:          Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:31 +0100\\n      Finished:         Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:38:31 +0100\\nListing 17.8\\nPod writing a termination message: termination-message.yaml\\nListing 17.9\\nSeeing the container’s termination message with kubectl describe\\nYou’re overriding the \\ndefault path of the \\ntermination message file.\\nThe container\\nwill write the\\nmessage to\\nthe file just\\nbefore exiting.\\nYou can see the reason \\nwhy the container died \\nwithout having to \\ninspect its logs.\\n \\n',\n",

Note that this mecha-\\nnism isn’t limited only to containers that crash. It can also be used in pods that run a\\ncompletable task and terminate successfully (you’ll find an example in the file termi-\\nnation-message-success.yaml). \\n This mechanism is great for terminated containers, but you’ll probably agree that\\na similar mechanism would also be useful for showing app-specific status messages of\\nrunning, not only terminated, containers. Kubernetes currently doesn’t provide any\\nsuch functionality and I’m not aware of any plans to introduce it.\\nNOTE\\nIf the container doesn’t write the message to any file, you can set the\\nterminationMessagePolicy field to FallbackToLogsOnError. In that case,\\nthe last few lines of the container’s log are used as its termination message\\n(but only when the container terminates unsuccessfully).\\n17.4.6 Handling application logs\\nWhile we’re on the subject of application logging, let’s reiterate that apps should write\\nto the standard output instead of files. This makes it easy to view logs with the kubectl\\nlogs command. \\nTIP\\nIf a container crashes and is replaced with a new one, you’ll see the new\\ncontainer’s log. To see the previous container’s logs, use the --previous\\noption with kubectl logs.\\nIf the application logs to a file instead of the standard output, you can display the log\\nfile using an alternative approach: \\n$ kubectl exec <pod> cat <logfile>\\nThis executes the cat command inside the container and streams the logs back to\\nkubectl, which prints them out in your terminal. \\nCOPYING LOG AND OTHER FILES TO AND FROM A CONTAINER\\nYou can also copy the log file to your local machine using the kubectl cp command,\\nwhich we haven’t looked at yet. It allows you to copy files from and into a container. For\\nexample, if a pod called foo-pod and its single container contains a file at /var/log/\\nfoo.log, you can transfer it to your local machine with the following command:\\n$ kubectl cp foo-pod:/var/log/foo.log foo.log\\nTo copy a file from your local machine into the pod, specify the pod’s name in the sec-\\nond argument:\\n$ kubectl cp localfile foo-pod:/etc/remotefile\\n \\n',\n",

If the pod has\\nmore than one container, you specify the container using the -c containerName option.\\nUSING CENTRALIZED LOGGING\\nIn a production system, you’ll want to use a centralized, cluster-wide logging solution,\\nso all your logs are collected and (permanently) stored in a central location. This\\nallows you to examine historical logs and analyze trends. Without such a system, a\\npod’s logs are only available while the pod exists. As soon as it’s deleted, its logs are\\ndeleted also. \\n Kubernetes by itself doesn’t provide any kind of centralized logging. The compo-\\nnents necessary for providing a centralized storage and analysis of all the container\\nlogs must be provided by additional components, which usually run as regular pods in\\nthe cluster. \\n Deploying centralized logging solutions is easy. All you need to do is deploy a few\\nYAML/JSON manifests and you’re good to go. On Google Kubernetes Engine, it’s\\neven easier. Check the Enable Stackdriver Logging checkbox when setting up the clus-\\nter. Setting up centralized logging on an on-premises Kubernetes cluster is beyond the\\nscope of this book, but I’ll give you a quick overview of how it’s usually done.\\n You may have already heard of the ELK stack composed of ElasticSearch, Logstash,\\nand Kibana. A slightly modified variation is the EFK stack, where Logstash is replaced\\nwith FluentD. \\n When using the EFK stack for centralized logging, each Kubernetes cluster node\\nruns a FluentD agent (usually as a pod deployed through a DaemonSet), which is\\nresponsible for gathering the logs from the containers, tagging them with pod-specific\\ninformation, and delivering them to ElasticSearch, which stores them persistently.\\nElasticSearch is also deployed as a pod somewhere in the cluster. The logs can then be\\nviewed and analyzed in a web browser through Kibana, which is a web tool for visualiz-\\ning ElasticSearch data. It also usually runs as a pod and is exposed through a Service.\\nThe three components of the EFK stack are shown in the following figure.\\nNOTE\\nIn the next chapter, you’ll learn about Helm charts. You can use charts\\ncreated by the Kubernetes community to deploy the EFK stack instead of cre-\\nating your own YAML manifests. \\nNode 1\\nContainer logs\\nKibana\\nWeb\\nbrowser\\nFluentD\\nNode 2\\nContainer logs\\nFluentD\\nNode 3\\nContainer logs\\nFluentD\\nElasticSearch\\nFigure 17.10\\nCentralized logging with FluentD, ElasticSearch, and Kibana\\n \\n',\n",

There’s one problem with that. Log statements spanning multiple lines,\\nsuch as exception stack traces in Java, appear as separate entries in the centralized\\nlogging system. \\n To solve this problem, you can have the apps output JSON instead of plain text.\\nThis way, a multiline log statement can be stored and shown in Kibana as a single\\nentry. But that makes viewing logs with kubectl logs much less human-friendly. \\n The solution may be to keep outputting human-readable logs to standard output,\\nwhile writing JSON logs to a file and having them processed by FluentD. This requires\\nconfiguring the node-level FluentD agent appropriately or adding a logging sidecar\\ncontainer to every pod. \\n17.5\\nBest practices for development and testing\\nWe’ve talked about what to be mindful of when developing apps, but we haven’t\\ntalked about the development and testing workflows that will help you streamline\\nthose processes. I don’t want to go into too much detail here, because everyone needs\\nto find what works best for them, but here are a few starting points.\\n17.5.1 Running apps outside of Kubernetes during development\\nWhen you’re developing an app that will run in a production Kubernetes cluster, does\\nthat mean you also need to run it in Kubernetes during development? Not really. Hav-\\ning to build the app after each minor change, then build the container image, push it\\nto a registry, and then re-deploy the pods would make development slow and painful.\\nLuckily, you don’t need to go through all that trouble.\\n You can always develop and run apps on your local machine, the way you’re used\\nto. After all, an app running in Kubernetes is a regular (although isolated) process\\nrunning on one of the cluster nodes. If the app depends on certain features the\\nKubernetes environment provides, you can easily replicate that environment on your\\ndevelopment machine.\\n I’m not even talking about running the app in a container. Most of the time, you\\ndon’t need that—you can usually run the app directly from your IDE. \\nCONNECTING TO BACKEND SERVICES\\nIn production, if the app connects to a backend Service and uses the BACKEND_SERVICE\\n_HOST and BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT environment variables to find the Service’s coordi-\\nnates, you can obviously set those environment variables on your local machine manu-\\nally and point them to the backend Service, regardless of if it’s running outside or\\ninside a Kubernetes cluster. If it’s running inside Kubernetes, you can always (at least\\ntemporarily) make the Service accessible externally by changing it to a NodePort or a\\nLoadBalancer-type Service. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '503\\nBest practices for development and testing\\nCONNECTING TO THE API SERVER\\nSimilarly, if your app requires access to the Kubernetes API server when running\\ninside a Kubernetes cluster, it can easily talk to the API server from outside the cluster\\nduring development. If it uses the ServiceAccount’s token to authenticate itself, you\\ncan always copy the ServiceAccount’s Secret’s files to your local machine with kubectl\\ncp. The API server doesn’t care if the client accessing it is inside or outside the cluster. \\n If the app uses an ambassador container like the one described in chapter 8, you\\ndon’t even need those Secret files. Run kubectl proxy on your local machine, run\\nyour app locally, and it should be ready to talk to your local kubectl proxy (as long as\\nit and the ambassador container bind the proxy to the same port).\\n In this case, you’ll need to make sure the user account your local kubectl is using\\nhas the same privileges as the ServiceAccount the app will run under.\\nRUNNING INSIDE A CONTAINER EVEN DURING DEVELOPMENT\\nWhen during development you absolutely have to run the app in a container for what-\\never reason, there is a way of avoiding having to build the container image every time.\\nInstead of baking the binaries into the image, you can always mount your local filesys-\\ntem into the container through Docker volumes, for example. This way, after you\\nbuild a new version of the app’s binaries, all you need to do is restart the container (or\\nnot even that, if hot-redeploy is supported). No need to rebuild the image.\\n17.5.2 Using Minikube in development\\nAs you can see, nothing forces you to run your app inside Kubernetes during develop-\\nment. But you may do that anyway to see how the app behaves in a true Kubernetes\\nenvironment.\\n You may have used Minikube to run examples in this book. Although a Minikube\\ncluster runs only a single worker node, it’s nevertheless a valuable method of trying\\nout your app in Kubernetes (and, of course, developing all the resource manifests that\\nmake up your complete application). Minikube doesn’t offer everything that a proper\\nmulti-node Kubernetes cluster usually provides, but in most cases, that doesn’t matter.\\nMOUNTING LOCAL FILES INTO THE MINIKUBE VM AND THEN INTO YOUR CONTAINERS\\nWhen you’re developing with Minikube and you’d like to try out every change to your\\napp in your Kubernetes cluster, you can mount your local filesystem into the Minikube\\nVM using the minikube mount command and then mount it into your containers\\nthrough a hostPath volume. You’ll find additional instructions on how to do that\\nin the Minikube documentation at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/minikube/tree/\\nmaster/docs.\\nUSING THE DOCKER DAEMON INSIDE THE MINIKUBE VM TO BUILD YOUR IMAGES\\nIf you’re developing your app with Minikube and planning to build the container\\nimage after every change, you can use the Docker daemon inside the Minikube VM to\\ndo the building, instead of having to build the image through your local Docker dae-\\nmon, push it to a registry, and then have it pulled by the daemon in the VM.

Luckily, this is much easier than it sounds. All you need to do is\\nrun the following command on your local machine:\\n$ eval $(minikube docker-env)\\nThis will set all the required environment variables for you. You then build your\\nimages the same way as if the Docker daemon was running on your local machine.\\nAfter you build the image, you don’t need to push it anywhere, because it’s already\\nstored locally on the Minikube VM, which means new pods can use the image immedi-\\nately. If your pods are already running, you either need to delete them or kill their\\ncontainers so they’re restarted.\\nBUILDING IMAGES LOCALLY AND COPYING THEM OVER TO THE MINIKUBE VM DIRECTLY\\nIf you can’t use the daemon inside the VM to build the images, you still have a way to\\navoid having to push the image to a registry and have the Kubelet running in the\\nMinikube VM pull it. If you build the image on your local machine, you can copy it\\nover to the Minikube VM with the following command:\\n$ docker save <image> | (eval $(minikube docker-env) && docker load)\\nAs before, the image is immediately ready to be used in a pod. But make sure the\\nimagePullPolicy in your pod spec isn’t set to Always, because that would cause the\\nimage to be pulled from the external registry again and you’d lose the changes you’ve\\ncopied over.\\nCOMBINING MINIKUBE WITH A PROPER KUBERNETES CLUSTER\\nYou have virtually no limit when developing apps with Minikube. You can even com-\\nbine a Minikube cluster with a proper Kubernetes cluster. I sometimes run my devel-\\nopment workloads in my local Minikube cluster and have them talk to my other\\nworkloads that are deployed in a remote multi-node Kubernetes cluster thousands of\\nmiles away. \\n Once I’m finished with development, I can move my local workloads to the remote\\ncluster with no modifications and with absolutely no problems thanks to how Kuber-\\nnetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure from the app.\\n17.5.3 Versioning and auto-deploying resource manifests\\nBecause Kubernetes uses a declarative model, you never have to figure out the current\\nstate of your deployed resources and issue imperative commands to bring that state to\\nwhat you desire. All you need to do is tell Kubernetes your desired state and it will take\\nall the necessary actions to reconcile the cluster state with the desired state.\\n You can store your collection of resource manifests in a Version Control System,\\nenabling you to perform code reviews, keep an audit trail, and roll back changes\\nwhenever necessary. After each commit, you can run the kubectl apply command to\\nhave your changes reflected in your deployed resources. \\n \\n',\n",

Luckily, the people at\\nBox (which coincidently was used to host this book’s manuscript and other materials)\\ndeveloped and released a tool called kube-applier, which does exactly what I described.\\nYou’ll find the tool’s source code at https:/\\n/github.com/box/kube-applier.\\n You can use multiple branches to deploy the manifests to a development, QA, stag-\\ning, and production cluster (or in different namespaces in the same cluster).\\n17.5.4 Introducing Ksonnet as an alternative to writing YAML/JSON \\nmanifests\\nWe’ve seen a number of YAML manifests throughout the book. I don’t see writing\\nYAML as too big of a problem, especially once you learn how to use kubectl explain\\nto see the available options, but some people do. \\n Just as I was finalizing the manuscript for this book, a new tool called Ksonnet was\\nannounced. It’s a library built on top of Jsonnet, which is a data templating language\\nfor building JSON data structures. Instead of writing the complete JSON by hand, it\\nlets you define parameterized JSON fragments, give them a name, and then build a\\nfull JSON manifest by referencing those fragments by name, instead of repeating the\\nsame JSON code in multiple locations—much like you use functions or methods in a\\nprogramming language. \\n Ksonnet defines the fragments you’d find in Kubernetes resource manifests, allow-\\ning you to quickly build a complete Kubernetes resource JSON manifest with much\\nless code. The following listing shows an example.\\nlocal k = import \"../ksonnet-lib/ksonnet.beta.1/k.libsonnet\";\\nlocal container = k.core.v1.container;\\nlocal deployment = k.apps.v1beta1.deployment;\\nlocal kubiaContainer =                              \\n  container.default(\"kubia\", \"luksa/kubia:v1\") +    \\n  container.helpers.namedPort(\"http\", 8080);        \\ndeployment.default(\"kubia\", kubiaContainer) +    \\ndeployment.mixin.spec.replicas(3)                \\nThe kubia.ksonnet file shown in the listing is converted to a full JSON Deployment\\nmanifest when you run the following command:\\n$ jsonnet kubia.ksonnet\\nListing 17.10\\nThe kubia Deployment written with Ksonnet: kubia.ksonnet\\nThis defines a container called kubia, \\nwhich uses the luksa/kubia:v1 image \\nand includes a port called http.\\nThis will be expanded into a full \\nDeployment resource.

Here, I’d like to point\\nyou specifically to the Fabric8 project (http:/\\n/fabric8.io), which is an integrated\\ndevelopment platform for Kubernetes. It includes Jenkins, the well-known, open-\\nsource automation system, and various other tools to deliver a full CI/CD pipeline\\nfor DevOps-style development, deployment, and management of microservices on\\nKubernetes.\\n If you’d like to build your own solution, I also suggest looking at one of the Google\\nCloud Platform’s online labs that talks about this subject.

A custom\\ncontroller will observe those high-level objects and create low-level objects based on\\nthem. For example, to run a messaging broker inside a Kubernetes cluster, all you’ll\\nneed to do is create an instance of a Queue resource and all the necessary Secrets,\\nDeployments, and Services will be created by a custom Queue controller. Kubernetes\\nalready provides ways of adding custom resources like this. \\n18.1.1 Introducing CustomResourceDefinitions\\nTo define a new resource type, all you need to do is post a CustomResourceDefinition\\nobject (CRD) to the Kubernetes API server. The CustomResourceDefinition object is\\nthe description of the custom resource type. Once the CRD is posted, users can then\\ncreate instances of the custom resource by posting JSON or YAML manifests to the\\nAPI server, the same as with any other Kubernetes resource.\\nNOTE\\nPrior to Kubernetes 1.7, custom resources were defined through Third-\\nPartyResource objects, which were similar to CustomResourceDefinitions, but\\nwere removed in version 1.8.\\nCreating a CRD so that users can create objects of the new type isn’t a useful feature if\\nthose objects don’t make something tangible happen in the cluster. Each CRD will\\nusually also have an associated controller (an active component doing something\\nbased on the custom objects), the same way that all the core Kubernetes resources\\nhave an associated controller, as was explained in chapter 11. For this reason, to prop-\\nerly show what CustomResourceDefinitions allow you to do other than adding\\ninstances of a custom object, a controller must be deployed as well. You’ll do that in\\nthe next example.\\nINTRODUCING THE EXAMPLE CUSTOMRESOURCEDEFINITION\\nLet’s imagine you want to allow users of your Kubernetes cluster to run static websites\\nas easily as possible, without having to deal with Pods, Services, and other Kubernetes\\nresources. What you want to achieve is for users to create objects of type Website that\\ncontain nothing more than the website’s name and the source from which the web-\\nsite’s files (HTML, CSS, PNG, and others) should be obtained. You’ll use a Git reposi-\\ntory as the source of those files. When a user creates an instance of the Website\\nresource, you want Kubernetes to spin up a new web server pod and expose it through\\na Service, as shown in figure 18.1.\\n To create the Website resource, you want users to post manifests along the lines of\\nthe one shown in the following listing.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

The proxy forwards the\\nrequest to the API server, taking care of both TLS encryption and authentication\\n(see figure 18.3).\\nThrough the connection opened by this HTTP GET request, the API server will send\\nwatch events for every change to any Website object.\\n The API server sends the ADDED watch event every time a new Website object is cre-\\nated. When the controller receives such an event, it extracts the Website’s name and\\nthe URL of the Git repository from the Website object it received in the watch event\\nand creates a Deployment and a Service object by posting their JSON manifests to the\\nAPI server. \\n The Deployment resource contains a template for a pod with two containers\\n(shown in figure 18.4): one running an nginx server and another one running a git-\\nsync process, which keeps a local directory synced with the contents of a Git repo.\\nThe local directory is shared with the nginx container through an emptyDir volume\\n(you did something similar to that in chapter 6, but instead of keeping the local\\ndirectory synced with a Git repo, you used a gitRepo volume to download the Git\\nrepo’s contents at pod startup; the volume’s contents weren’t kept in sync with the\\nGit repo afterward). The Service is a NodePort Service, which exposes your web\\nserver pod through a random port on each node (the same port is used on all\\nnodes). When a pod is created by the Deployment object, clients can access the web-\\nsite through the node port.\\nPod: website-controller\\nContainer: main\\nWebsite controller\\nGET http://localhost:8001/apis/extensions.\\nexample.com/v1/websites?watch=true\\nGET https://kubernetes:443/apis/extensions.\\nexample.com/v1/websites?watch=true\\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\\nContainer: proxy\\nkubectl proxy\\nAPI server\\nFigure 18.3\\nThe Website controller talks to the API server through a proxy (in the ambassador container).\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '515\\nDefining custom API objects\\nThe API server also sends a DELETED watch event when a Website resource instance is\\ndeleted. Upon receiving the event, the controller deletes the Deployment and the Ser-\\nvice resources it created earlier. As soon as a user deletes the Website instance, the\\ncontroller will shut down and remove the web server serving that website.\\nNOTE\\nMy oversimplified controller isn’t implemented properly. The way it\\nwatches the API objects doesn’t guarantee it won’t miss individual watch\\nevents. The proper way to watch objects through the API server is to not only\\nwatch them, but also periodically re-list all objects in case any watch events\\nwere missed. \\nRUNNING THE CONTROLLER AS A POD\\nDuring development, I ran the controller on my local development laptop and used a\\nlocally running kubectl proxy process (not running as a pod) as the ambassador to\\nthe Kubernetes API server. This allowed me to develop quickly, because I didn’t need\\nto build a container image after every change to the source code and then run it\\ninside Kubernetes. \\n When I’m ready to deploy the controller into production, the best way is to run the\\ncontroller inside Kubernetes itself, the way you do with all the other core controllers.\\nTo run the controller in Kubernetes, you can deploy it through a Deployment resource.\\nThe following listing shows an example of such a Deployment.\\napiVersion: apps/v1beta1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: website-controller\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 1                      \\n  template:\\nListing 18.5\\nA Website controller Deployment: website-controller.yaml\\nPod\\nWebserver\\ncontainer\\nWeb client\\ngit-sync\\ncontainer\\nServes website to\\nweb client through\\na random port\\nClones Git repo\\ninto volume and\\nkeeps it synced\\nemptyDir\\nvolume\\nFigure 18.4\\nThe pod serving \\nthe website specified in the \\nWebsite object\\nYou’ll run a single \\nreplica of the \\ncontroller.\\n \\n',\n",

I’ll leave the imple-\\nmentation of these additional features to you as an exercise.\\n18.1.3 Validating custom objects\\nYou may have noticed that you didn’t specify any kind of validation schema in the Web-\\nsite CustomResourceDefinition. Users can include any field they want in the YAML of\\ntheir Website object. The API server doesn’t validate the contents of the YAML (except\\nthe usual fields like apiVersion, kind, and metadata), so users can create invalid\\nWebsite objects (without a gitRepo field, for example). \\n Is it possible to add validation to the controller and prevent invalid objects from\\nbeing accepted by the API server? It isn’t, because the API server first stores the object,\\nthen returns a success response to the client (kubectl), and only then notifies all the\\nwatchers (the controller is one of them). All the controller can really do is validate\\nthe object when it receives it in a watch event, and if the object is invalid, write the\\nerror message to the Website object (by updating the object through a new request to\\nthe API server). The user wouldn’t be notified of the error automatically. They’d have\\nListing 18.7\\nThe Deployment, Service, and Pod created for the kubia-website\\n \\n',\n",

Unless\\nthe user does this, they have no way of knowing whether the object is valid or not.\\n This obviously isn’t ideal. You’d want the API server to validate the object and\\nreject invalid objects immediately. Validation of custom objects was introduced in\\nKubernetes version 1.8 as an alpha feature. To have the API server validate your cus-\\ntom objects, you need to enable the CustomResourceValidation feature gate in the\\nAPI server and specify a JSON schema in the CRD.\\n18.1.4 Providing a custom API server for your custom objects\\nA better way of adding support for custom objects in Kubernetes is to implement your\\nown API server and have the clients talk directly to it. \\nINTRODUCING API SERVER AGGREGATION\\nIn Kubernetes version 1.7, you can integrate your custom API server with the main\\nKubernetes API server, through API server aggregation. Initially, the Kubernetes API\\nserver was a single monolithic component. From Kubernetes version 1.7, multiple\\naggregated API servers will be exposed at a single location. Clients can connect to the\\naggregated API and have their requests transparently forwarded to the appropriate\\nAPI server. This way, the client wouldn’t even be aware that multiple API servers han-\\ndle different objects behind the scenes. Even the core Kubernetes API server may\\neventually end up being split into multiple smaller API servers and exposed as a single\\nserver through the aggregator, as shown in figure 18.5.\\nIn your case, you could create an API server responsible for handling your Website\\nobjects. It could validate those objects the way the core Kubernetes API server validates\\nthem. You’d no longer need to create a CRD to represent those objects, because you’d\\nimplement the Website object type into the custom API server directly. \\n Generally, each API server is responsible for storing their own resources. As shown\\nin figure 18.5, it can either run its own instance of etcd (or a whole etcd cluster), or it\\nMain\\nAPI server\\nCustom\\nAPI server Y\\nCustom\\nAPI server X\\nkubectl\\nUses its own etcd instance\\nfor storing its resources\\nUses CustomResourceDeﬁnitions\\nin main API server as storage\\nmechanism\\netcd\\netcd\\nFigure 18.5\\nAPI server aggregation\\n \\n',\n",

In that case, it needs to create a CRD object first, before creating\\ninstances of the CRD, the way you did in the example.\\nREGISTERING A CUSTOM API SERVER\\nTo add a custom API server to your cluster, you’d deploy it as a pod and expose it\\nthrough a Service. Then, to integrate it into the main API server, you’d deploy a YAML\\nmanifest describing an APIService resource like the one in the following listing.\\napiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1   \\nkind: APIService                             \\nmetadata:\\n  name: v1alpha1.extensions.example.com\\nspec:\\n  group: extensions.example.com           \\n  version: v1alpha1                      \\n  priority: 150\\n  service:                    \\n    name: website-api         \\n    namespace: default        \\nAfter creating the APIService resource from the previous listing, client requests sent\\nto the main API server that contain any resource from the extensions.example.com\\nAPI group and version v1alpha1 would be forwarded to the custom API server pod(s)\\nexposed through the website-api Service. \\nCREATING CUSTOM CLIENTS\\nWhile you can create custom resources from YAML files using the regular kubectl cli-\\nent, to make deployment of custom objects even easier, in addition to providing a cus-\\ntom API server, you can also build a custom CLI tool. This will allow you to add\\ndedicated commands for manipulating those objects, similar to how kubectl allows\\ncreating Secrets, Deployments, and other resources through resource-specific com-\\nmands like kubectl create secret or kubectl create deployment.\\n As I’ve already mentioned, custom API servers, API server aggregation, and other\\nfeatures related to extending Kubernetes are currently being worked on intensively, so\\nthey may change after the book is published. To get up-to-date information on the\\nsubject, refer to the Kubernetes GitHub repos at http:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes.\\n18.2\\nExtending Kubernetes with the Kubernetes Service \\nCatalog\\nOne of the first additional API servers that will be added to Kubernetes through API\\nserver aggregation is the Service Catalog API server. The Service Catalog is a hot topic\\nin the Kubernetes community, so you may want to know about it. \\n Currently, for a pod to consume a service (here I use the term generally, not in\\nrelation to Service resources; for example, a database service includes everything\\nListing 18.8\\nAn APIService YAML definition \\nThis is an APIService \\nresource.\\nThe API group this API \\nserver is responsible for\\nThe supported API version\\nThe Service the custom API \\nserver is exposed through\\n \\n',\n",

That someone is usually the same user\\ndeploying the client pod or, if a team is dedicated to deploying these types of general\\nservices, the user needs to file a ticket and wait for the team to provision the service.\\nThis means the user needs to either create the manifests for all the components of the\\nservice, know where to find an existing set of manifests, know how to configure it\\nproperly, and deploy it manually, or wait for the other team to do it. \\n But Kubernetes is supposed to be an easy-to-use, self-service system. Ideally, users\\nwhose apps require a certain service (for example, a web application requiring a back-\\nend database), should be able to say to Kubernetes. “Hey, I need a PostgreSQL data-\\nbase. Please provision one and tell me where and how I can connect to it.” This will\\nsoon be possible through the Kubernetes Service Catalog. \\n18.2.1 Introducing the Service Catalog\\nAs the name suggests, the Service Catalog is a catalog of services. Users can browse\\nthrough the catalog and provision instances of the services listed in the catalog by\\nthemselves without having to deal with Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and other resources\\nrequired for the service to run. You’ll recognize that this is similar to what you did\\nwith the Website custom resource.\\n Instead of adding custom resources to the API server for each type of service, the\\nService Catalog introduces the following four generic API resources:\\n\\uf0a1A ClusterServiceBroker, which describes an (external) system that can provision\\nservices\\n\\uf0a1A ClusterServiceClass, which describes a type of service that can be provisioned\\n\\uf0a1A ServiceInstance, which is one instance of a service that has been provisioned\\n\\uf0a1A ServiceBinding, which represents a binding between a set of clients (pods)\\nand a ServiceInstance\\nThe relationships between those four resources are shown in the figure 18.6 and\\nexplained in the following paragraphs.\\nIn a nutshell, a cluster admin creates a ClusterServiceBroker resource for each service\\nbroker whose services they’d like to make available in the cluster. Kubernetes then asks\\nthe broker for a list of services that it can provide and creates a ClusterServiceClass\\nresource for each of them. When a user requires a service to be provisioned, they create\\nan ServiceInstance resource and then a ServiceBinding to bind that ServiceInstance to\\nClient pods\\nServiceBinding\\nServiceInstance\\nClusterServiceClass(es)\\nClusterServiceBroker\\nFigure 18.6\\nThe relationships between Service Catalog API resources. \\n \\n',\n",

The API is relatively simple.\\nIt’s a REST API providing the following operations:\\n\\uf0a1Retrieving the list of services with GET /v2/catalog\\n\\uf0a1Provisioning a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id)\\n\\uf0a1Updating a service instance (PATCH /v2/service_instances/:id)\\n\\uf0a1Binding a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bind-\\nings/:binding_id)\\n\\uf0a1Unbinding an instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bind-\\nings/:binding_id)\\n\\uf0a1Deprovisioning a service instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id)\\nYou’ll find the OpenServiceBroker API spec at https:/\\n/github.com/openservicebro-\\nkerapi/servicebroker.\\nREGISTERING BROKERS IN THE SERVICE CATALOG\\nThe cluster administrator registers a broker by posting a ServiceBroker resource man-\\nifest to the Service Catalog API, like the one shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1    \\nkind: ClusterServiceBroker                                  \\nmetadata:\\n  name: database-broker                          \\nspec:\\n  url: http://database-osbapi.myorganization.org  \\nThe listing describes an imaginary broker that can provision databases of different\\ntypes.

You’re also specifying a parameter, which is specific for each broker and Cluster-\\nServiceClass. Let’s imagine you looked up the possible parameters in the broker’s doc-\\numentation.\\n As soon as you create this resource, the Service Catalog will contact the broker the\\nClusterServiceClass belongs to and ask it to provision the service. It will pass on the\\nchosen ClusterServiceClass and plan names, as well as all the parameters you specified.\\n It’s then completely up to the broker to know what to do with this information.

Another team has implemented a broker\\nthat makes it easy to provision Amazon Web Services. \\n In general, service brokers allow easy provisioning and exposing of services in\\nKubernetes and will make Kubernetes an even more awesome platform for deploying\\nyour applications. \\n18.3\\nPlatforms built on top of Kubernetes\\nI’m sure you’ll agree that Kubernetes is a great system by itself. Given that it’s easily\\nextensible across all its components, it’s no wonder companies that had previously\\ndeveloped their own custom platforms are now re-implementing them on top of\\nKubernetes. Kubernetes is, in fact, becoming a widely accepted foundation for the\\nnew generation of Platform-as-a-Service offerings.\\n Among the best-known PaaS systems built on Kubernetes are Deis Workflow and\\nRed Hat’s OpenShift. We’ll do a quick overview of both systems to give you a sense of\\nwhat they offer on top of all the awesome stuff Kubernetes already offers.\\n18.3.1 Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a Platform-as-a-Service and as such, it has a strong focus on\\ndeveloper experience. Among its goals are enabling rapid development of applica-\\ntions, as well as easy deployment, scaling, and long-term maintenance of those apps.\\nOpenShift has been around much longer than Kubernetes. Versions 1 and 2 were\\nbuilt from the ground up and had nothing to do with Kubernetes, but when Kuberne-\\ntes was announced, Red Hat decided to rebuild OpenShift version 3 from scratch—\\nthis time on top of Kubernetes. When a company such as Red Hat decides to throw\\naway an old version of their software and build a new one on top of an existing tech-\\nnology like Kubernetes, it should be clear to everyone how great Kubernetes is.\\n Kubernetes automates rollouts and application scaling, whereas OpenShift also auto-\\nmates the actual building of application images and their automatic deployment with-\\nout requiring you to integrate a Continuous Integration solution into your cluster. \\n OpenShift also provides user and group management, which allows you to run a\\nproperly secured multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster, where individual users are only\\nallowed to access their own Kubernetes namespaces and the apps running in those\\nnamespaces are also fully network-isolated from each other by default. \\nINTRODUCING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN OPENSHIFT\\nOpenShift provides some additional API objects in addition to all those available in\\nKubernetes.

These features pre-date the Role-\\nBased Access Control, which is now the standard in vanilla Kubernetes.\\n Each user has access to certain Projects, which are nothing more than Kubernetes\\nNamespaces with additional annotations. Users can only act on resources that reside\\nin the projects the user has access to. Access to the project is granted by a cluster\\nadministrator. \\nINTRODUCING APPLICATION TEMPLATES\\nKubernetes makes it possible to deploy a set of resources through a single JSON or\\nYAML manifest. OpenShift takes this a step further by allowing that manifest to be\\nparameterizable. A parameterizable list in OpenShift is called a Template; it’s a list of\\nobjects whose definitions can include placeholders that get replaced with parameter\\nvalues when you process and then instantiate a template (see figure 18.8).\\nThe template itself is a JSON or YAML file containing a list of parameters that are ref-\\nerenced in resources defined in that same JSON/YAML. The template can be stored\\nin the API server like any other object. Before a template can be instantiated, it needs\\nTemplate\\nParameters\\nAPP_NAME=\"kubia\"\\nVOL_CAPACITY=\"5 Gi\"\\n...\\nPod\\nname: $(APP_NAME)\\nService\\nname: $(APP_NAME)\\nTemplate\\nPod\\nname: kubia\\nService\\nname: kubia\\nPod\\nname: kubia\\nService\\nname: kubia\\nProcess\\nCreate\\nFigure 18.8\\nOpenShift templates\\n \\n',\n",

To process a template, you supply the values for the template’s\\nparameters and then OpenShift replaces the references to the parameters with those\\nvalues. The result is a processed template, which is exactly like a Kubernetes resource\\nlist that can then be created with a single POST request.\\n OpenShift provides a long list of pre-fabricated templates that allow users to\\nquickly run complex applications by specifying a few arguments (or none at all, if the\\ntemplate provides good defaults for those arguments). For example, a template can\\nenable the creation of all the Kubernetes resources necessary to run a Java EE appli-\\ncation inside an Application Server, which connects to a back-end database, also\\ndeployed as part of that same template. All those components can be deployed with a\\nsingle command.\\nBUILDING IMAGES FROM SOURCE USING BUILDCONFIGS\\nOne of the best features of OpenShift is the ability to have OpenShift build and imme-\\ndiately deploy an application in the OpenShift cluster by pointing it to a Git repository\\nholding the application’s source code. You don’t need to build the container image at\\nall—OpenShift does that for you. This is done by creating a resource called Build-\\nConfig, which can be configured to trigger builds of container images immediately\\nafter a change is committed to the source Git repository. \\n Although OpenShift doesn’t monitor the Git repository itself, a hook in the repos-\\nitory can notify OpenShift of the new commit. OpenShift will then pull the changes\\nfrom the Git repository and start the build process. A build mechanism called Source\\nTo Image can detect what type of application is in the Git repository and run the\\nproper build procedure for it. For example, if it detects a pom.xml file, which is used\\nin Java Maven-formatted projects, it runs a Maven build. The resulting artifacts are\\npackaged into an appropriate container image, and are then pushed to an internal\\ncontainer registry (provided by OpenShift). From there, they can be pulled and run\\nin the cluster immediately. \\n By creating a BuildConfig object, developers can thus point to a Git repo and not\\nworry about building container images. Developers have almost no need to know\\nanything about containers. Once the ops team deploys an OpenShift cluster and\\ngives developers access to it, those developers can develop their code, commit, and\\npush it to a Git repo, the same way they used to before we started packaging apps into\\ncontainers. Then OpenShift takes care of building, deploying, and managing apps\\nfrom that code.\\nAUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYING NEWLY BUILT IMAGES WITH DEPLOYMENTCONFIGS\\nOnce a new container image is built, it can also automatically be deployed in the clus-\\nter. This is enabled by creating a DeploymentConfig object and pointing it to an\\nImageStream. As the name suggests, an ImageStream is a stream of images. When an\\nimage is built, it’s added to the ImageStream. This enables the DeploymentConfig to\\nnotice the newly built image and allows it to take action and initiate a rollout of the\\nnew image (see figure 18.9).\\n \\n',\n",

Like a Deployment object, it has a configurable strategy for transition-\\ning between Deployments. It contains a pod template used to create the actual pods,\\nbut it also allows you to configure pre- and post-deployment hooks. In contrast to a\\nKubernetes Deployment, it creates ReplicationControllers instead of ReplicaSets and\\nprovides a few additional features.\\nEXPOSING SERVICES EXTERNALLY USING ROUTES\\nEarly on, Kubernetes didn’t provide Ingress objects. To expose Services to the outside\\nworld, you needed to use NodePort or LoadBalancer-type Services. But at that time,\\nOpenShift already provided a better option through a Route resource. A Route is sim-\\nilar to an Ingress, but it provides additional configuration related to TLS termination\\nand traffic splitting. \\n Similar to an Ingress controller, a Route needs a Router, which is a controller that\\nprovides the load balancer or proxy. In contrast to Kubernetes, the Router is available\\nout of the box in OpenShift. \\nTRYING OUT OPENSHIFT\\nIf you’re interested in trying out OpenShift, you can start by using Minishift, which is\\nthe OpenShift equivalent of Minikube, or you can try OpenShift Online Starter at\\nhttps:/\\n/manage.openshift.com, which is a free multi-tenant, hosted solution provided\\nto get you started with OpenShift. \\n18.3.2 Deis Workflow and Helm\\nA company called Deis, which has recently been acquired by Microsoft, also provides a\\nPaaS called Workflow, which is also built on top of Kubernetes.

We’ll take a\\nbrief look at both.\\nINTRODUCING DEIS WORKFLOW\\nYou can deploy Deis Workflow to any existing Kubernetes cluster (unlike OpenShift,\\nwhich is a complete cluster with a modified API server and other Kubernetes compo-\\nnents). When you run Workflow, it creates a set of Services and ReplicationControllers,\\nwhich then provide developers with a simple, developer-friendly environment. \\n Deploying new versions of your app is triggered by pushing your changes with git\\npush deis master and letting Workflow take care of the rest. Similar to OpenShift,\\nWorkflow also provides a source to image mechanism, application rollouts and roll-\\nbacks, edge routing, and also log aggregation, metrics, and alerting, which aren’t\\navailable in core Kubernetes. \\n To run Workflow in your Kubernetes cluster, you first need to install the Deis Work-\\nflow and Helm CLI tools and then install Workflow into your cluster. We won’t go into\\nhow to do that here, but if you’d like to learn more, visit the website at https:/\\n/deis\\n.com/workflow. What we’ll explore here is the Helm tool, which can be used without\\nWorkflow and has gained popularity in the community.\\nDEPLOYING RESOURCES THROUGH HELM\\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes (similar to OS package managers like yum\\nor apt in Linux or homebrew in MacOS). \\n Helm is comprised of two things:\\n\\uf0a1A helm CLI tool (the client).\\n\\uf0a1Tiller, a server component running as a Pod inside the Kubernetes cluster.\\nThose two components are used to deploy and manage application packages in a\\nKubernetes cluster. Helm application packages are called Charts. They’re combined\\nwith a Config, which contains configuration information and is merged into a Chart\\nto create a Release, which is a running instance of an application (a combined Chart\\nand Config). You deploy and manage Releases using the helm CLI tool, which talks to\\nthe Tiller server, which is the component that creates all the necessary Kubernetes\\nresources defined in the Chart, as shown in figure 18.10.\\n You can create charts yourself and keep them on your local disk, or you can use\\nany existing chart, which is available in the growing list of helm charts maintained by\\nthe community at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/charts. The list includes charts for\\napplications such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Magento, Memcached, MongoDB,\\nOpenVPN, PHPBB, RabbitMQ, Redis, WordPress, and others.\\n Similar to how you don’t build and install apps developed by other people to your\\nLinux system manually, you probably don’t want to build and manage your own\\nKubernetes manifests for such applications, right? That’s why you’ll want to use Helm\\nand the charts available in the GitHub repository I mentioned. \\n \\n',\n",

For example, to run MySQL in your Kubernetes cluster, all you need to do is\\nclone the charts Git repo to your local machine and run the following command (pro-\\nvided you have Helm’s CLI tool and Tiller running in your cluster):\\n$ helm install --name my-database stable/mysql\\nThis will create all the necessary Deployments, Services, Secrets, and PersistentVolu-\\nmeClaims needed to run MySQL in your cluster.

The name is used to refer to the context,\\nuser, or cluster. \\nCLUSTERS\\nA cluster entry represents a Kubernetes cluster and contains the URL of the API\\nserver, the certificate authority (CA) file, and possibly a few other configuration\\noptions related to communication with the API server. The CA certificate can be\\nstored in a separate file and referenced in the kubeconfig file, or it can be included in\\nit directly in the certificate-authority-data field.\\nUSERS\\nEach user defines the credentials to use when talking to an API server. This can be a\\nusername and password pair, an authentication token, or a client key and certificate.\\nThe certificate and key can be included in the kubeconfig file (through the client-\\ncertificate-data and client-key-data properties) or stored in separate files and\\nreferenced in the config file, as shown in listing A.1.\\nCONTEXTS\\nA context ties together a cluster, a user, and the default namespace kubectl should use\\nwhen performing commands. Multiple contexts can point to the same user or cluster. \\nTHE CURRENT CONTEXT\\nWhile there can be multiple contexts defined in the kubeconfig file, at any given time\\nonly one of them is the current context. Later we’ll see how the current context can\\nbe changed.\\nA.2.3\\nListing, adding, and modifying kube config entries\\nYou can edit the file manually to add, modify, and remove clusters, users, or contexts,\\nbut you can also do it through one of the kubectl config commands.\\nADDING OR MODIFYING A CLUSTER\\nTo add another cluster, use the kubectl config set-cluster command:\\n$ kubectl config set-cluster my-other-cluster \\n➥ --server=https://k8s.example.com:6443 \\n➥ --certificate-authority=path/to/the/cafile\\nThis will add a cluster called my-other-cluster with the API server located at https:/\\n/\\nk8s.example.com:6443. To see additional options you can pass to the command, run\\nkubectl config set-cluster to have it print out usage examples.\\n If a cluster by that name already exists, the set-cluster command will overwrite\\nits configuration options. \\nADDING OR MODIFYING USER CREDENTIALS\\nAdding and modifying users is similar to adding or modifying a cluster. To add a user\\nthat authenticates with the API server using a username and password, run the follow-\\ning command:\\n$ kubectl config set-credentials foo --username=foo --password=pass\\n \\n',\n",

If you use the same\\ncredentials for authenticating against different clusters, you can define a single user\\nand use it with both clusters. \\nTYING CLUSTERS AND USER CREDENTIALS TOGETHER\\nA context defines which user to use with which cluster, but can also define the name-\\nspace that kubectl should use, when you don’t specify the namespace explicitly with\\nthe --namespace or -n option.\\n The following command is used to create a new context that ties together the clus-\\nter and the user you created:\\n$ kubectl config set-context some-context --cluster=my-other-cluster \\n➥ --user=foo --namespace=bar\\nThis creates a context called some-context that uses the my-other-cluster cluster\\nand the foo user credentials. The default namespace in this context is set to bar. \\n You can also use the same command to change the namespace of your current\\ncontext, for example. You can get the name of the current context like so:\\n$ kubectl config current-context\\nminikube\\nYou then change the namespace like this:\\n$ kubectl config set-context minikube --namespace=another-namespace\\nRunning this simple command once is much more user-friendly compared to having\\nto include the --namespace option every time you run kubectl.\\nTIP\\nTo easily switch between namespaces, define an alias like this: alias\\nkcd='kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context)\\n--namespace '.

It has also deployed the kube-\\nproxy, making Kubernetes services available from the master node. \\nB.2.1\\nUnderstanding how kubeadm runs the components\\nAll these components are running as containers. You can use the docker ps command\\nto confirm this. But kubeadm doesn’t use Docker directly to run them. It deploys their\\nYAML descriptors to the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory. This directory is moni-\\ntored by the Kubelet, which then runs these components through Docker. The com-\\nponents run as Pods. You can see them with the kubectl get command. But first, you\\nneed to configure kubectl.\\nRUNNING KUBECTL ON THE MASTER\\nYou installed kubectl along with docker, kubeadm, and other packages in one of the\\ninitial steps. But you can’t use kubectl to talk to your cluster without first configuring\\nit through a kubeconfig file.\\n Luckily, the necessary configuration is stored in the /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf\\nfile. All you need to do is make kubectl use it by setting the KUBECONFIG environment\\nvariable, as explained in appendix A:\\n# export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf\\nLISTING THE PODS\\nTo test kubectl, you can list the pods of the Control Plane (they’re in the kube-system\\nnamespace), as shown in the following listing.\\n# kubectl get po -n kube-system\\nNAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\netcd-master.k8s                      1/1       Running   0          21m\\nkube-apiserver-master.k8s            1/1       Running   0          22m\\nkube-controller-manager-master.k8s   1/1       Running   0          21m\\nkube-dns-3913472980-cn6kz            0/3       Pending   0          22m\\nkube-proxy-qb709                     1/1       Running   0          22m\\nkube-scheduler-master.k8s            1/1       Running   0          21m\\nLISTING NODES\\nYou’re finished with setting up the master, but you still need to set up the nodes.\\nAlthough you already installed the Kubelet on both of your two worker nodes (you\\neither installed each node separately or cloned the initial VM after you installed all\\nthe required packages), they aren’t part of your Kubernetes cluster yet. You can see\\nthat by listing nodes with kubectl:\\n# kubectl get node\\nNAME         STATUS     ROLES     AGE       VERSION\\nmaster.k8s   NotReady   master    2m        v1.8.4\\nListing B.5\\nSystem pods in the kube-system namespace\\n \\n',\n",

Like Docker, it\\nruns applications in isolated containers, using the same Linux technologies as\\nthose used by Docker. Let’s look at how rkt differs from Docker and how to try it in\\nMinikube.\\n The first great thing about rkt is that it directly supports the notion of a Pod\\n(running multiple related containers), unlike Docker, which only runs individual\\ncontainers. Rkt is based on open standards and was built with security in mind from\\nthe start (for example, images are signed, so you can be sure they haven’t been tam-\\npered with). Unlike Docker, which initially had a client-server based architecture\\nthat didn’t play well with init systems such as systemd, rkt is a CLI tool that runs\\nyour container directly, instead of telling a daemon to run it. A nice thing about rkt\\nis that it can run existing Docker-formatted container images, so you don’t need to\\nrepackage your applications to get started with rkt.\\nC.1.1\\nConfiguring Kubernetes to use rkt\\nAs you may remember from chapter 11, the Kubelet is the only Kubernetes\\ncomponent that talks to the Container Runtime. To get Kubernetes to use rkt\\ninstead of Docker, you need to configure the Kubelet to use it by running it with\\nthe --container-runtime=rkt command-line option. But be aware that support\\nfor rkt isn’t as mature as support for Docker. \\n Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on how to\\nuse rkt and what is or isn’t supported. Here, we’ll go over a quick example to get\\nyou started.\\n \\n',\n",

To use rkt as the container runtime in Minikube, all you\\nneed to do is start Minikube with the following two options:\\n$ minikube start --container-runtime=rkt --network-plugin=cni \\nNOTE\\nYou may need to run minikube delete to delete the existing Minikube\\nVM first. \\nThe --container-runtime=rkt option obviously configures the Kubelet to use rkt as\\nthe Container Runtime, whereas the --network-plugin=cni makes it use the Con-\\ntainer Network Interface as the network plugin. Without this option, pods won’t run,\\nso it’s imperative you use it.\\nRUNNING A POD\\nOnce the Minikube VM is up, you can interact with Kubernetes exactly like before.\\nYou can deploy the kubia app with the kubectl run command, for example:\\n$ kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia --port 8080\\ndeployment \"kubia\" created\\nWhen the pod starts up, you can see it’s running through rkt by inspecting its contain-\\ners with kubectl describe, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe pods\\nName:           kubia-3604679414-l1nn3\\n...\\nStatus:         Running\\nIP:             10.1.0.2\\nControllers:    ReplicaSet/kubia-3604679414\\nContainers:\\n  kubia:\\n    Container ID:       rkt://87a138ce-...-96e375852997:kubia    \\n    Image:              luksa/kubia\\n    Image ID:           rkt://sha512-5bbc5c7df6148d30d74e0...    \\n...\\nYou can also try hitting the pod’s HTTP port to see if it’s responding properly to\\nHTTP requests.

Notice how the bottom two con-\\ntainers don’t have anything listed in the UUID or STATE columns? That’s because they\\nbelong to the same pod as the kubedns container listed above them. \\n Rkt prints containers belonging to the same pod grouped together. Each pod\\n(instead of each container) has its own UUID and state. If you tried doing this when\\nyou were using Docker as the Container Runtime, you’ll appreciate how much easier\\nit is to see all the pods and their containers with rkt. You’ll notice no infrastructure\\ncontainer exists for each pod (we explained them in chapter 11).

CRI\\nis a plugin API enabling easy integration of other container runtimes with Kuberne-\\ntes. People are now free to plug other container runtimes into Kubernetes without\\nhaving to dig deep into Kubernetes code. All they need to do is implement a few inter-\\nface methods. \\n From Kubernetes version 1.6 onward, CRI is the default interface the Kubelet uses.\\nBoth Docker and rkt are now used through the CRI (no longer directly).\\nC.2.1\\nIntroducing the CRI-O Container Runtime\\nBeside Docker and rkt, a new CRI implementation called CRI-O allows Kubernetes to\\ndirectly launch and manage OCI-compliant containers, without requiring you to\\ndeploy any additional Container Runtime. \\n You can try CRI-O with Minikube by starting it with --container-runtime=crio.\\nC.2.2\\nRunning apps in virtual machines instead of containers \\nKubernetes is a container orchestration system, right?

You may find it surprising that’s no longer the case.\\n New CRI implementations are being developed that allow Kubernetes to run apps\\nin virtual machines instead of in containers. One such implementation, called Frakti,\\nallows you to run regular Docker-based container images directly through a hypervi-\\nsor, which means each container runs its own kernel. This allows much better isola-\\ntion between containers compared to when they use the same kernel. \\n And there’s more. Another CRI implementation is the Mirantis Virtlet, which\\nmakes it possible to run actual VM images (in the QCOW2 image file format, which is\\none of the formats used by the QEMU virtual machine tool) instead of container\\nimages. When you use the Virtlet as the CRI plugin, Kubernetes spins up a VM for\\neach pod. How awesome is that?\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '559\\nUnderstanding federated API objects\\nD.3.2\\nUnderstanding what federated resources do\\nFor part of the federated objects, when you create the object in the Federation API\\nserver, the controllers running in the Federation Controller Manager will create regu-\\nlar cluster-scoped resources in all underlying Kubernetes clusters and manage them\\nuntil the federated object is deleted. \\n For certain federated resource types, the resources created in the underlying clus-\\nters are exact replicas of the federated resource; for others, they’re slightly modified\\nversions, whereas certain federated resources don’t cause anything to be created in\\nthe underlying clusters at all. The replicas are kept in sync with the original federated\\nversions. But the synchronization is one-directional only—from the federation server\\ndown to the underlying clusters. If you modify the resource in an underlying cluster,\\nthe changes will not be synced up to the Federation API server.\\n For example, if you create a namespace in the federated API server, a namespace\\nwith the same name will be created in all underlying clusters. If you then create a fed-\\nerated ConfigMap inside that namespace, a ConfigMap with that exact name and con-\\ntents will be created in all underlying clusters, in the same namespace. This also applies\\nto Secrets, Services, and DaemonSets.\\n ReplicaSets and Deployments are different. They aren’t blindly copied to the\\nunderlying clusters, because that’s not what the user usually wants. After all, if you cre-\\nate a Deployment with a desired replica count of 10, you probably don’t want 10 pod\\nreplicas running in each underlying cluster. You want 10 replicas in total. Because of\\nthis, when you specify a desired replica count in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, the Fed-\\neration controllers create underlying Deployments/ReplicaSets so that the sum of\\ntheir desired replica counts equals the desired replica count specified in the federated\\nDeployment or ReplicaSet. By default, the replicas are spread evenly across the clus-\\nters, but this can be overridden.\\nNOTE\\nCurrently, you need to connect to each cluster’s API server individu-\\nally to get the list of pods running in that cluster. You can’t list all the clusters’\\npods through the Federated API server.\\nA federated Ingress resource, on the other hand, doesn’t result in the creation of any\\nIngress objects in the underlying clusters. You may remember from chapter 5 that an\\nIngress represents a single point of entry for external clients to a Service. Because of\\nthis, a federated Ingress resource creates a global, multi-cluster-wide entry point to the\\nServices across all underlying clusters. \\nNOTE\\nAs for regular Ingresses, a federated Ingress controller is required\\nfor this. \\nSetting up federated Kubernetes clusters is outside the scope of this book, so you can\\nlearn more about the subject by referring to the Cluster Federation sections in the\\nuser and administration guides in the Kubernetes online documentation at http:/\\n/\\nkubernetes.io/docs/.\\n \\n',\n",
