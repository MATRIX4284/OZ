Introducing services

  ports:
  - name: http              
    port: 80                
    targetPort: 8080        
  - name: https             
    port: 443               
    targetPort: 8443        
  selector:                 
    app: kubia              
NOTE
The label selector applies to the service as a whole—it can’t be config-
ured for each port individually. If you want different ports to map to different
subsets of pods, you need to create two services.
Because your kubia pods don’t listen on multiple ports, creating a multi-port service
and a multi-port pod is left as an exercise to you.
USING NAMED PORTS
In all these examples, you’ve referred to the target port by its number, but you can also
give a name to each pod’s port and refer to it by name in the service spec. This makes
the service spec slightly clearer, especially if the port numbers aren’t well-known.
 For example, suppose your pod defines names for its ports as shown in the follow-
ing listing.
kind: Pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kubia
    ports:
    - name: http               
      containerPort: 8080      
    - name: https              
      containerPort: 8443      
You can then refer to those ports by name in the service spec, as shown in the follow-
ing listing.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service             
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http              
    port: 80                
    targetPort: http        
  - name: https             
    port: 443               
    targetPort: https

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
But why should you even bother with naming ports? The biggest benefit of doing so is
that it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service
spec. Your pod currently uses port 8080 for http, but what if you later decide you’d
like to move that to port 80? 
 If you’re using named ports, all you need to do is change the port number in the
pod spec (while keeping the port’s name unchanged). As you spin up pods with the
new ports, client connections will be forwarded to the appropriate port numbers,
depending on the pod receiving the connection (port 8080 on old pods and port 80
on the new ones).
5.1.2
Discovering services
By creating a service, you now have a single and stable IP address and port that you
can hit to access your pods. This address will remain unchanged throughout the
whole lifetime of the service. Pods behind this service may come and go, their IPs may
change, their number can go up or down, but they’ll always be accessible through the
service’s single and constant IP address. 
 But how do the client pods know the IP and port of a service? Do you need to cre-
ate the service first, then manually look up its IP address and pass the IP to the config-
uration options of the client pod? Not really. Kubernetes also provides ways for client
pods to discover a service’s IP and port.
DISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
When a pod is started, Kubernetes initializes a set of environment variables pointing
to each service that exists at that moment. If you create the service before creating the
client pods, processes in those pods can get the IP address and port of the service by
inspecting their environment variables. 
 Let’s see what those environment variables look like by examining the environment
of one of your running pods. You’ve already learned that you can use the kubectl exec
command to run a command in the pod, but because you created the service only
after your pods had been created, the environment variables for the service couldn’t
have been set yet. You’ll need to address that first.
 Before you can see environment variables for your service, you first need to delete
all the pods and let the ReplicationController create new ones. You may remember
you can delete all pods without specifying their names like this:
$ kubectl delete po --all
pod ""kubia-7nog1"" deleted
pod ""kubia-bf50t"" deleted
pod ""kubia-gzwli"" deleted
Now you can list the new pods (I’m sure you know how to do that) and pick one as
your target for the kubectl exec command. Once you’ve selected your target pod,
you can list environment variables by running the env command inside the container,
as shown in the following listing.

...
Two services are defined in your cluster: the kubernetes and the kubia service (you
saw this earlier with the kubectl get svc command); consequently, two sets of service-
related environment variables are in the list. Among the variables that pertain to the
kubia service you created at the beginning of the chapter, you’ll see the KUBIA_SERVICE
_HOST and the KUBIA_SERVICE_PORT environment variables, which hold the IP address
and port of the kubia service, respectively. 
 Turning back to the frontend-backend example we started this chapter with, when
you have a frontend pod that requires the use of a backend database server pod, you
can expose the backend pod through a service called backend-database and then
have the frontend pod look up its IP address and port through the environment vari-
ables BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_HOST and BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_PORT.
NOTE
Dashes in the service name are converted to underscores and all let-
ters are uppercased when the service name is used as the prefix in the envi-
ronment variable’s name. 
Environment variables are one way of looking up the IP and port of a service, but isn’t
this usually the domain of DNS? Why doesn’t Kubernetes include a DNS server and
allow you to look up service IPs through DNS instead? As it turns out, it does!
DISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH DNS
Remember in chapter 3 when you listed pods in the kube-system namespace? One of
the pods was called kube-dns. The kube-system namespace also includes a corre-
sponding service with the same name.
 As the name suggests, the pod runs a DNS server, which all other pods running in
the cluster are automatically configured to use (Kubernetes does that by modifying
each container’s /etc/resolv.conf file). Any DNS query performed by a process run-
ning in a pod will be handled by Kubernetes’ own DNS server, which knows all the ser-
vices running in your system. 
NOTE
Whether a pod uses the internal DNS server or not is configurable
through the dnsPolicy property in each pod’s spec.
Each service gets a DNS entry in the internal DNS server, and client pods that know
the name of the service can access it through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
instead of resorting to environment variables.

IP of the service.

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
CONNECTING TO THE SERVICE THROUGH ITS FQDN
To revisit the frontend-backend example, a frontend pod can connect to the backend-
database service by opening a connection to the following FQDN:
backend-database.default.svc.cluster.local
backend-database corresponds to the service name, default stands for the name-
space the service is defined in, and svc.cluster.local is a configurable cluster
domain suffix used in all cluster local service names. 
NOTE
The client must still know the service’s port number. If the service is
using a standard port (for example, 80 for HTTP or 5432 for Postgres), that
shouldn’t be a problem. If not, the client can get the port number from the
environment variable.
Connecting to a service can be even simpler than that. You can omit the svc.cluster
.local suffix and even the namespace, when the frontend pod is in the same name-
space as the database pod. You can thus refer to the service simply as backend-
database. That’s incredibly simple, right?
 Let’s try this. You’ll try to access the kubia service through its FQDN instead of its
IP. Again, you’ll need to do that inside an existing pod. You already know how to use
kubectl exec to run a single command in a pod’s container, but this time, instead of
running the curl command directly, you’ll run the bash shell instead, so you can then
run multiple commands in the container. This is similar to what you did in chapter 2
when you entered the container you ran with Docker by using the docker exec -it
bash command. 
RUNNING A SHELL IN A POD’S CONTAINER
You can use the kubectl exec command to run bash (or any other shell) inside a
pod’s container. This way you’re free to explore the container as long as you want,
without having to perform a kubectl exec for every command you want to run.
NOTE
The shell’s binary executable must be available in the container image
for this to work.
To use the shell properly, you need to pass the -it option to kubectl exec:
$ kubectl exec -it kubia-3inly bash
root@kubia-3inly:/# 
You’re now inside the container. You can use the curl command to access the kubia
service in any of the following ways:
root@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia.default.svc.cluster.local
You’ve hit kubia-5asi2
root@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia.default
You’ve hit kubia-3inly

Connecting to services living outside the cluster
root@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia
You’ve hit kubia-8awf3
You can hit your service by using the service’s name as the hostname in the requested
URL. You can omit the namespace and the svc.cluster.local suffix because of how
the DNS resolver inside each pod’s container is configured. Look at the /etc/resolv.conf
file in the container and you’ll understand:
root@kubia-3inly:/# cat /etc/resolv.conf
search default.svc.cluster.local svc.cluster.local cluster.local ...
UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU CAN’T PING A SERVICE IP
One last thing before we move on. You know how to create services now, so you’ll soon
create your own. But what if, for whatever reason, you can’t access your service?
 You’ll probably try to figure out what’s wrong by entering an existing pod and try-
ing to access the service like you did in the last example. Then, if you still can’t access
the service with a simple curl command, maybe you’ll try to ping the service IP to see
if it’s up. Let’s try that now:
root@kubia-3inly:/# ping kubia
PING kubia.default.svc.cluster.local (10.111.249.153): 56 data bytes
^C--- kubia.default.svc.cluster.local ping statistics ---
54 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss
Hmm. curl-ing the service works, but pinging it doesn’t. That’s because the service’s
cluster IP is a virtual IP, and only has meaning when combined with the service port.
We’ll explain what that means and how services work in chapter 11. I wanted to men-
tion that here because it’s the first thing users do when they try to debug a broken
service and it catches most of them off guard.
5.2
Connecting to services living outside the cluster
Up to now, we’ve talked about services backed by one or more pods running inside
the cluster. But cases exist when you’d like to expose external services through the
Kubernetes services feature. Instead of having the service redirect connections to
pods in the cluster, you want it to redirect to external IP(s) and port(s). 
 This allows you to take advantage of both service load balancing and service discov-
ery. Client pods running in the cluster can connect to the external service like they
connect to internal services.
5.2.1
Introducing service endpoints
Before going into how to do this, let me first shed more light on services. Services
don’t link to pods directly. Instead, a resource sits in between—the Endpoints
resource. You may have already noticed endpoints if you used the kubectl describe
command on your service, as shown in the following listing.

An Endpoints resource (yes, plural) is a list of IP addresses and ports exposing a ser-
vice. The Endpoints resource is like any other Kubernetes resource, so you can display
its basic info with kubectl get:
$ kubectl get endpoints kubia
NAME    ENDPOINTS                                         AGE
kubia   10.108.1.4:8080,10.108.2.5:8080,10.108.2.6:8080   1h
Although the pod selector is defined in the service spec, it’s not used directly when
redirecting incoming connections. Instead, the selector is used to build a list of IPs
and ports, which is then stored in the Endpoints resource. When a client connects to a
service, the service proxy selects one of those IP and port pairs and redirects the
incoming connection to the server listening at that location.
5.2.2
Manually configuring service endpoints
You may have probably realized this already, but having the service’s endpoints decou-
pled from the service allows them to be configured and updated manually. 
 If you create a service without a pod selector, Kubernetes won’t even create the
Endpoints resource (after all, without a selector, it can’t know which pods to include
in the service). It’s up to you to create the Endpoints resource to specify the list of
endpoints for the service.
 To create a service with manually managed endpoints, you need to create both a
Service and an Endpoints resource. 
CREATING A SERVICE WITHOUT A SELECTOR
You’ll first create the YAML for the service itself, as shown in the following listing.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-service     
spec:                       
  ports:
  - port: 80                  
Listing 5.7
Full details of a service displayed with kubectl describe
Listing 5.8
A service without a pod selector: external-service.yaml
The service’s pod 
selector is used to 
create the list of 
endpoints.
The list of pod
IPs and ports
that represent
the endpoints of
this service
The name of the service must 
match the name of the Endpoints 
object (see next listing).
This service has no 
selector defined.

Clients connect to a service, and the service proxy selects one of those IP and port pairs and redirects the incoming connection to the server listening at that location.","[{'highlight': 'A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of pods and provides network access to them.'}, {'highlight': 'The Endpoints resource is a list of IP addresses and ports exposing a service, and can be manually configured and updated.'}, {'highlight': 'To create a service with manually managed endpoints, you need to create both a Service and an Endpoints resource.'}, {'highlight': 'The pod selector in the service spec is used to build a list of IPs and ports, which is then stored in the Endpoints resource.'}, {'highlight': 'When a client connects to a service, the service proxy selects one of the IP and port pairs from the Endpoints resource and redirects the incoming connection to the server listening at that location.'}]"

Connecting to services living outside the cluster
You’re defining a service called external-service that will accept incoming connec-
tions on port 80. You didn’t define a pod selector for the service.
CREATING AN ENDPOINTS RESOURCE FOR A SERVICE WITHOUT A SELECTOR
Endpoints are a separate resource and not an attribute of a service. Because you cre-
ated the service without a selector, the corresponding Endpoints resource hasn’t been
created automatically, so it’s up to you to create it. The following listing shows its
YAML manifest.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Endpoints
metadata:
  name: external-service      
subsets:
  - addresses:
    - ip: 11.11.11.11         
    - ip: 22.22.22.22         
    ports:
    - port: 80      
The Endpoints object needs to have the same name as the service and contain the list
of target IP addresses and ports for the service. After both the Service and the End-
points resource are posted to the server, the service is ready to be used like any regular
service with a pod selector. Containers created after the service is created will include
the environment variables for the service, and all connections to its IP:port pair will be
load balanced between the service’s endpoints. 
 Figure 5.4 shows three pods connecting to the service with external endpoints.
If you later decide to migrate the external service to pods running inside Kubernetes,
you can add a selector to the service, thereby making its Endpoints managed automat-
ically. The same is also true in reverse—by removing the selector from a Service,

must match the name of the 
service (see previous listing).

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
Kubernetes stops updating its Endpoints. This means a service IP address can remain
constant while the actual implementation of the service is changed. 
5.2.3
Creating an alias for an external service
Instead of exposing an external service by manually configuring the service’s End-
points, a simpler method allows you to refer to an external service by its fully qualified
domain name (FQDN).
CREATING AN EXTERNALNAME SERVICE
To create a service that serves as an alias for an external service, you create a Service
resource with the type field set to ExternalName. For example, let’s imagine there’s a
public API available at api.somecompany.com. You can define a service that points to
it as shown in the following listing.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-service
spec:
  type: ExternalName                       
  externalName: someapi.somecompany.com     
  ports:
  - port: 80
After the service is created, pods can connect to the external service through the
external-service.default.svc.cluster.local domain name (or even external-
service) instead of using the service’s actual FQDN. This hides the actual service
name and its location from pods consuming the service, allowing you to modify the
service definition and point it to a different service any time later, by only changing
the externalName attribute or by changing the type back to ClusterIP and creating
an Endpoints object for the service—either manually or by specifying a label selector
on the service and having it created automatically.
 ExternalName services are implemented solely at the DNS level—a simple CNAME
DNS record is created for the service. Therefore, clients connecting to the service will
connect to the external service directly, bypassing the service proxy completely. For
this reason, these types of services don’t even get a cluster IP. 
NOTE
A CNAME record points to a fully qualified domain name instead of a
numeric IP address.
5.3
Exposing services to external clients
Up to now, we’ve only talked about how services can be consumed by pods from inside
the cluster. But you’ll also want to expose certain services, such as frontend webserv-
ers, to the outside, so external clients can access them, as depicted in figure 5.5.

Exposing services to external clients
You have a few ways to make a service accessible externally:
Setting the service type to NodePort—For a NodePort service, each cluster node
opens a port on the node itself (hence the name) and redirects traffic received
on that port to the underlying service. The service isn’t accessible only at the
internal cluster IP and port, but also through a dedicated port on all nodes. 
Setting the service type to LoadBalancer, an extension of the NodePort type—This
makes the service accessible through a dedicated load balancer, provisioned
from the cloud infrastructure Kubernetes is running on. The load balancer redi-
rects traffic to the node port across all the nodes. Clients connect to the service
through the load balancer’s IP.
Creating an Ingress resource, a radically different mechanism for exposing multiple ser-
vices through a single IP address—It operates at the HTTP level (network layer 7)
and can thus offer more features than layer 4 services can. We’ll explain Ingress
resources in section 5.4. 
5.3.1
Using a NodePort service
The first method of exposing a set of pods to external clients is by creating a service
and setting its type to NodePort. By creating a NodePort service, you make Kubernetes
reserve a port on all its nodes (the same port number is used across all of them) and
forward incoming connections to the pods that are part of the service. 
 This is similar to a regular service (their actual type is ClusterIP), but a NodePort
service can be accessed not only through the service’s internal cluster IP, but also
through any node’s IP and the reserved node port. 
 This will make more sense when you try interacting with a NodePort service.
CREATING A NODEPORT SERVICE
You’ll now create a NodePort service to see how you can use it. The following listing
shows the YAML for the service.

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia-nodeport
spec:
  type: NodePort            
  ports:
  - port: 80                 
    targetPort: 8080        
    nodePort: 30123        
  selector:
    app: kubia
You set the type to NodePort and specify the node port this service should be bound to
across all cluster nodes. Specifying the port isn’t mandatory; Kubernetes will choose a
random port if you omit it. 
NOTE
When you create the service in GKE, kubectl prints out a warning
about having to configure firewall rules. We’ll see how to do that soon. 
EXAMINING YOUR NODEPORT SERVICE
Let’s see the basic information of your service to learn more about it:
$ kubectl get svc kubia-nodeport
NAME             CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
kubia-nodeport   10.111.254.223   <nodes>       80:30123/TCP   2m
Look at the EXTERNAL-IP column. It shows <nodes>, indicating the service is accessible
through the IP address of any cluster node. The PORT(S) column shows both the
internal port of the cluster IP (80) and the node port (30123). The service is accessi-
ble at the following addresses:

10.11.254.223:80

<1st node’s IP>:30123

<2nd node’s IP>:30123, and so on.
Figure 5.6 shows your service exposed on port 30123 of both of your cluster nodes
(this applies if you’re running this on GKE; Minikube only has a single node, but the
principle is the same). An incoming connection to one of those ports will be redi-
rected to a randomly selected pod, which may or may not be the one running on the
node the connection is being made to. 
 
 
 
Listing 5.11
A NodePort service definition: kubia-svc-nodeport.yaml
Set the service 
type to NodePort.
This is the port of the 
service’s internal cluster IP.
This is the target port 
of the backing pods.
The service will be accessible 
through port 30123 of each of 
your cluster nodes.
