Exposing services to external clients
A connection received on port 30123 of the first node might be forwarded either to
the pod running on the first node or to one of the pods running on the second node.
CHANGING FIREWALL RULES TO LET EXTERNAL CLIENTS ACCESS OUR NODEPORT SERVICE
As I’ve mentioned previously, before you can access your service through the node
port, you need to configure the Google Cloud Platform’s firewalls to allow external
connections to your nodes on that port. You’ll do this now:
$ gcloud compute firewall-rules create kubia-svc-rule --allow=tcp:30123
Created [https://www.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/kubia-
1295/global/firewalls/kubia-svc-rule].
NAME            NETWORK  SRC_RANGES  RULES      SRC_TAGS  TARGET_TAGS
kubia-svc-rule  default  0.0.0.0/0   tcp:30123
You can access your service through port 30123 of one of the node’s IPs. But you need
to figure out the IP of a node first. Refer to the sidebar on how to do that.

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
Once you know the IPs of your nodes, you can try accessing your service through them:
$ curl http://130.211.97.55:30123
You've hit kubia-ym8or
$ curl http://130.211.99.206:30123
You've hit kubia-xueq1
TIP
When using Minikube, you can easily access your NodePort services
through your browser by running minikube service <service-name> [-n
<namespace>].
As you can see, your pods are now accessible to the whole internet through port 30123
on any of your nodes. It doesn’t matter what node a client sends the request to. But if
you only point your clients to the first node, when that node fails, your clients can’t
access the service anymore. That’s why it makes sense to put a load balancer in front
of the nodes to make sure you’re spreading requests across all healthy nodes and
never sending them to a node that’s offline at that moment. 
 If your Kubernetes cluster supports it (which is mostly true when Kubernetes is
deployed on cloud infrastructure), the load balancer can be provisioned automati-
cally by creating a LoadBalancer instead of a NodePort service. We’ll look at this next.
5.3.2
Exposing a service through an external load balancer
Kubernetes clusters running on cloud providers usually support the automatic provi-
sion of a load balancer from the cloud infrastructure. All you need to do is set the
Using JSONPath to get the IPs of all your nodes 
You can find the IP in the JSON or YAML descriptors of the nodes. But instead of
sifting through the relatively large JSON, you can tell kubectl to print out only the
node IP instead of the whole service definition: 
$ kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[*].status.
➥ addresses[?(@.type==""ExternalIP"")].address}'
130.211.97.55 130.211.99.206
You’re telling kubectl to only output the information you want by specifying a
JSONPath. You’re probably familiar with XPath and how it’s used with XML. JSONPath
is basically XPath for JSON. The JSONPath in the previous example instructs kubectl
to do the following:
Go through all the elements in the items attribute.
For each element, enter the status attribute.
Filter elements of the addresses attribute, taking only those that have the
type attribute set to ExternalIP.
Finally, print the address attribute of the filtered elements.
To learn more about how to use JSONPath with kubectl, refer to the documentation
at http:/
/kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/jsonpath.

Exposing services to external clients
service’s type to LoadBalancer instead of NodePort. The load balancer will have its
own unique, publicly accessible IP address and will redirect all connections to your
service. You can thus access your service through the load balancer’s IP address. 
 If Kubernetes is running in an environment that doesn’t support LoadBalancer
services, the load balancer will not be provisioned, but the service will still behave like
a NodePort service. That’s because a LoadBalancer service is an extension of a Node-
Port service. You’ll run this example on Google Kubernetes Engine, which supports
LoadBalancer services. Minikube doesn’t, at least not as of this writing. 
CREATING A LOADBALANCER SERVICE
To create a service with a load balancer in front, create the service from the following
YAML manifest, as shown in the following listing.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: kubia-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer          
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: kubia
The service type is set to LoadBalancer instead of NodePort. You’re not specifying a spe-
cific node port, although you could (you’re letting Kubernetes choose one instead). 
CONNECTING TO THE SERVICE THROUGH THE LOAD BALANCER
After you create the service, it takes time for the cloud infrastructure to create the
load balancer and write its IP address into the Service object. Once it does that, the IP
address will be listed as the external IP address of your service:
$ kubectl get svc kubia-loadbalancer
NAME                 CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)         AGE
kubia-loadbalancer   10.111.241.153   130.211.53.173   80:32143/TCP    1m
In this case, the load balancer is available at IP 130.211.53.173, so you can now access
the service at that IP address:
$ curl http://130.211.53.173
You've hit kubia-xueq1
Success! As you may have noticed, this time you didn’t need to mess with firewalls the
way you had to before with the NodePort service.

a load balancer from the

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
See figure 5.7 to see how HTTP requests are delivered to the pod. External clients
(curl in your case) connect to port 80 of the load balancer and get routed to the
Session affinity and web browsers
Because your service is now exposed externally, you may try accessing it with your
web browser. You’ll see something that may strike you as odd—the browser will hit
the exact same pod every time. Did the service’s session affinity change in the
meantime? With kubectl explain, you can double-check that the service’s session
affinity is still set to None, so why don’t different browser requests hit different
pods, as is the case when using curl?
Let me explain what’s happening. The browser is using keep-alive connections and
sends all its requests through a single connection, whereas curl opens a new
connection every time. Services work at the connection level, so when a connection to a
service is first opened, a random pod is selected and then all network packets belonging
to that connection are all sent to that single pod. Even if session affinity is set to None,
users will always hit the same pod (until the connection is closed).

Exposing services to external clients
implicitly assigned node port on one of the nodes. From there, the connection is for-
warded to one of the pod instances.
 As already mentioned, a LoadBalancer-type service is a NodePort service with an
additional infrastructure-provided load balancer. If you use kubectl describe to dis-
play additional info about the service, you’ll see that a node port has been selected for
the service. If you were to open the firewall for this port, the way you did in the previ-
ous section about NodePort services, you could access the service through the node
IPs as well.
TIP
If you’re using Minikube, even though the load balancer will never be
provisioned, you can still access the service through the node port (at the
Minikube VM’s IP address).
5.3.3
Understanding the peculiarities of external connections
You must be aware of several things related to externally originating connections to
services. 
UNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING UNNECESSARY NETWORK HOPS
When an external client connects to a service through the node port (this also
includes cases when it goes through the load balancer first), the randomly chosen
pod may or may not be running on the same node that received the connection. An
additional network hop is required to reach the pod, but this may not always be
desirable. 
 You can prevent this additional hop by configuring the service to redirect external
traffic only to pods running on the node that received the connection. This is done by
setting the externalTrafficPolicy field in the service’s spec section:
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ...
If a service definition includes this setting and an external connection is opened
through the service’s node port, the service proxy will choose a locally running pod. If
no local pods exist, the connection will hang (it won’t be forwarded to a random
global pod, the way connections are when not using the annotation). You therefore
need to ensure the load balancer forwards connections only to nodes that have at
least one such pod.
 Using this annotation also has other drawbacks. Normally, connections are spread
evenly across all the pods, but when using this annotation, that’s no longer the case.
 Imagine having two nodes and three pods. Let’s say node A runs one pod and
node B runs the other two. If the load balancer spreads connections evenly across the
two nodes, the pod on node A will receive 50% of all connections, but the two pods on
node B will only receive 25% each, as shown in figure 5.8.

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
BEING AWARE OF THE NON-PRESERVATION OF THE CLIENT’S IP
Usually, when clients inside the cluster connect to a service, the pods backing the ser-
vice can obtain the client’s IP address. But when the connection is received through a
node port, the packets’ source IP is changed, because Source Network Address Trans-
lation (SNAT) is performed on the packets. 
 The backing pod can’t see the actual client’s IP, which may be a problem for some
applications that need to know the client’s IP. In the case of a web server, for example,
this means the access log won’t show the browser’s IP.
 The Local external traffic policy described in the previous section affects the pres-
ervation of the client’s IP, because there’s no additional hop between the node receiv-
ing the connection and the node hosting the target pod (SNAT isn’t performed).
5.4
Exposing services externally through an Ingress 
resource
You’ve now seen two ways of exposing a service to clients outside the cluster, but
another method exists—creating an Ingress resource.
DEFINITION
Ingress (noun)—The act of going in or entering; the right to
enter; a means or place of entering; entryway. 
Let me first explain why you need another way to access Kubernetes services from the
outside. 
UNDERSTANDING WHY INGRESSES ARE NEEDED
One important reason is that each LoadBalancer service requires its own load bal-
ancer with its own public IP address, whereas an Ingress only requires one, even when
providing access to dozens of services. When a client sends an HTTP request to the
Ingress, the host and path in the request determine which service the request is for-
warded to, as shown in figure 5.9.

Exposing services externally through an Ingress resource
Ingresses operate at the application layer of the network stack (HTTP) and can pro-
vide features such as cookie-based session affinity and the like, which services can’t.
UNDERSTANDING THAT AN INGRESS CONTROLLER IS REQUIRED
Before we go into the features an Ingress object provides, let me emphasize that to
make Ingress resources work, an Ingress controller needs to be running in the cluster.
Different Kubernetes environments use different implementations of the controller,
but several don’t provide a default controller at all. 
 For example, Google Kubernetes Engine uses Google Cloud Platform’s own HTTP
load-balancing features to provide the Ingress functionality. Initially, Minikube didn’t
provide a controller out of the box, but it now includes an add-on that can be enabled
to let you try out the Ingress functionality. Follow the instructions in the following
sidebar to ensure it’s enabled.
Enabling the Ingress add-on in Minikube
If you’re using Minikube to run the examples in this book, you’ll need to ensure the
Ingress add-on is enabled. You can check whether it is by listing all the add-ons:
$ minikube addons list
- default-storageclass: enabled
- kube-dns: enabled
- heapster: disabled
- ingress: disabled               
- registry-creds: disabled
- addon-manager: enabled
- dashboard: enabled
You’ll learn about what these add-ons are throughout the book, but it should be
pretty clear what the dashboard and the kube-dns add-ons do. Enable the Ingress
add-on so you can see Ingresses in action:
$ minikube addons enable ingress

CHAPTER 5
Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
TIP
The --all-namespaces option mentioned in the sidebar is handy when
you don’t know what namespace your pod (or other type of resource) is in, or
if you want to list resources across all namespaces.
5.4.1
Creating an Ingress resource
You’ve confirmed there’s an Ingress controller running in your cluster, so you can
now create an Ingress resource. The following listing shows what the YAML manifest
for the Ingress looks like.
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: kubia
spec:
  rules:
  - host: kubia.example.com             
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /                           
        backend:
          serviceName: kubia-nodeport     
          servicePort: 80                 
This defines an Ingress with a single rule, which makes sure all HTTP requests received
by the Ingress controller, in which the host kubia.example.com is requested, will be
sent to the kubia-nodeport service on port 80. 
(continued)
This should have spun up an Ingress controller as another pod. Most likely, the
controller pod will be in the kube-system namespace, but not necessarily, so list all
the running pods across all namespaces by using the --all-namespaces option:
$ kubectl get po --all-namespaces
NAMESPACE    NAME                            READY  STATUS    RESTARTS AGE
default      kubia-rsv5m                     1/1    Running   0        13h
default      kubia-fe4ad                     1/1    Running   0        13h
default      kubia-ke823                     1/1    Running   0        13h
kube-system  default-http-backend-5wb0h      1/1    Running   0        18m
kube-system  kube-addon-manager-minikube     1/1    Running   3        6d
kube-system  kube-dns-v20-101vq              3/3    Running   9        6d
kube-system  kubernetes-dashboard-jxd9l      1/1    Running   3        6d
kube-system  nginx-ingress-controller-gdts0  1/1    Running   0        18m
At the bottom of the output, you see the Ingress controller pod. The name suggests
that Nginx (an open-source HTTP server and reverse proxy) is used to provide the
Ingress functionality.
Listing 5.13
An Ingress resource definition: kubia-ingress.yaml
This Ingress maps the 
kubia.example.com domain 
name to your service.
All requests will be sent to 
port 80 of the kubia-
nodeport service.

Exposing services externally through an Ingress resource
NOTE
Ingress controllers on cloud providers (in GKE, for example) require
the Ingress to point to a NodePort service. But that’s not a requirement of
Kubernetes itself.
5.4.2
Accessing the service through the Ingress
To access your service through http:/
/kubia.example.com, you’ll need to make sure
the domain name resolves to the IP of the Ingress controller. 
OBTAINING THE IP ADDRESS OF THE INGRESS
To look up the IP, you need to list Ingresses:
$ kubectl get ingresses
NAME      HOSTS               ADDRESS          PORTS     AGE
kubia     kubia.example.com   192.168.99.100   80        29m
NOTE
When running on cloud providers, the address may take time to appear,
because the Ingress controller provisions a load balancer behind the scenes.
The IP is shown in the ADDRESS column. 
ENSURING THE HOST CONFIGURED IN THE INGRESS POINTS TO THE INGRESS’ IP ADDRESS
Once you know the IP, you can then either configure your DNS servers to resolve
kubia.example.com to that IP or you can add the following line to /etc/hosts (or
C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on Windows):
192.168.99.100    kubia.example.com
ACCESSING PODS THROUGH THE INGRESS
Everything is now set up, so you can access the service at http:/
/kubia.example.com
(using a browser or curl):
$ curl http://kubia.example.com
You've hit kubia-ke823
You’ve successfully accessed the service through an Ingress. Let’s take a better look at
how that unfolded.
UNDERSTANDING HOW INGRESSES WORK
Figure 5.10 shows how the client connected to one of the pods through the Ingress
controller. The client first performed a DNS lookup of kubia.example.com, and the
DNS server (or the local operating system) returned the IP of the Ingress controller.
The client then sent an HTTP request to the Ingress controller and specified
kubia.example.com in the Host header. From that header, the controller determined
which service the client is trying to access, looked up the pod IPs through the End-
points object associated with the service, and forwarded the client’s request to one of
the pods.
 As you can see, the Ingress controller didn’t forward the request to the service. It
only used it to select a pod. Most, if not all, controllers work like this.

Services: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods
5.4.3
Exposing multiple services through the same Ingress
If you look at the Ingress spec closely, you’ll see that both rules and paths are arrays,
so they can contain multiple items. An Ingress can map multiple hosts and paths to
multiple services, as you’ll see next. Let’s focus on paths first. 
MAPPING DIFFERENT SERVICES TO DIFFERENT PATHS OF THE SAME HOST
You can map multiple paths on the same host to different services, as shown in the
following listing.
...
  - host: kubia.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /kubia                
        backend:                    
          serviceName: kubia        
          servicePort: 80           
      - path: /foo                
        backend:                  
          serviceName: bar        
          servicePort: 80         
In this case, requests will be sent to two different services, depending on the path in
the requested URL. Clients can therefore reach two different services through a single
IP address (that of the Ingress controller).
