       " 'text': '57\\nIntroducing pods\\n Therefore, you need to run each process in its own container. That’s how Docker\\nand Kubernetes are meant to be used. \\n3.1.2\\nUnderstanding pods\\nBecause you’re not supposed to group multiple processes into a single container, it’s\\nobvious you need another higher-level construct that will allow you to bind containers\\ntogether and manage them as a single unit. This is the reasoning behind pods. \\n A pod of containers allows you to run closely related processes together and pro-\\nvide them with (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single\\ncontainer, while keeping them somewhat isolated. This way, you get the best of both\\nworlds. You can take advantage of all the features containers provide, while at the\\nsame time giving the processes the illusion of running together. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE PARTIAL ISOLATION BETWEEN CONTAINERS OF THE SAME POD\\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that containers are completely isolated from\\neach other, but now you see that you want to isolate groups of containers instead of\\nindividual ones. You want containers inside each group to share certain resources,\\nalthough not all, so that they’re not fully isolated. Kubernetes achieves this by config-\\nuring Docker to have all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces\\ninstead of each container having its own set. \\n Because all containers of a pod run under the same Network and UTS namespaces\\n(we’re talking about Linux namespaces here), they all share the same hostname and\\nnetwork interfaces. Similarly, all containers of a pod run under the same IPC namespace\\nand can communicate through IPC. In the latest Kubernetes and Docker versions, they\\ncan also share the same PID namespace, but that feature isn’t enabled by default. \\nNOTE\\nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, you\\nonly see the container’s own processes when running ps aux in the container.\\nBut when it comes to the filesystem, things are a little different. Because most of the\\ncontainer’s filesystem comes from the container image, by default, the filesystem of\\neach container is fully isolated from other containers. However, it’s possible to have\\nthem share file directories using a Kubernetes concept called a Volume, which we’ll\\ntalk about in chapter 6.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS SHARE THE SAME IP AND PORT SPACE\\nOne thing to stress here is that because containers in a pod run in the same Network\\nnamespace, they share the same IP address and port space. This means processes run-\\nning in containers of the same pod need to take care not to bind to the same port\\nnumbers or they’ll run into port conflicts. But this only concerns containers in the\\nsame pod. Containers of different pods can never run into port conflicts, because\\neach pod has a separate port space. All the containers in a pod also have the same\\nloopback network interface, so a container can communicate with other containers in\\nthe same pod through localhost.\\n \\n',\n",

      "1. **Service Catalog**: The Service Catalog API allows users to provision services using external service brokers registered with ServiceBroker resources. Cluster administrators can register these brokers through the OpenServiceBroker API.\n",
      "2. **ClusterServiceClasses**: These are similar to StorageClasses but allow users to select the type of service they want to use. An example is shown for a PostgreSQL database, with two plans: free and premium.\n",
      "3. **Provisioning Services**: To provision a service instance, create a ServiceInstance resource with ClusterServiceClass and plan specified. The Service Catalog will contact the broker, and the broker will provision the service according to its configuration.\n",
      "4. **Binding Services**: A ServiceBinding resource can be used to bind a provisioned ServiceInstance to pods. This creates a Secret with necessary credentials, which can be manually mounted into pods for access to the ServiceInstance.\n",
      "5. **Service Catalog and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)**: The Service Catalog allows service providers to expose services in any Kubernetes cluster by registering a broker. Platforms built on top of Kubernetes, such as Deis Workflow and Red Hat's OpenShift, provide features like easy provisioning, automated rollouts and scaling, user and group management, and additional API objects.\n",
      "6. **OpenShift**: This is a PaaS built on top of Kubernetes that provides powerful user management features, application templates, and automatic deployment of newly built images.\n",
      "7. **Extending Kubernetes**: Features from OpenShift can be extended to Kubernetes, such as DeploymentConfig, which provides pre- and post-deployment hooks and creates ReplicationControllers instead of ReplicaSets.\n",
      "8. **Helm**: This is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows the deployment and management of application packages called Charts.\n",
