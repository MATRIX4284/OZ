The  entropy  is  a  statistical  parameter  which  measures,\\nin  a  certain  sense,  how  much  information  is  produced  on  the  average  for\\neach letter of a text in the language. If the language is translated into binary\\ndigits (0 or 1) in the most efficient way, the entropy // is the average number\\nof binary digits required per letter of the original language.  The redundancy,\\non the other hand, measures the amount of constraint imposed on a text in\\nthe  language  due  to  its  statistical  structure,  e.g.,  in  English  the  high  fre-\\nquency of  the  letter £,  the strong  tendency of H to  follow  T or of  V  to  follow\\nQ.  It  was  estimated  that  when  statistical  effects  extending  over  not  more\\nthan  eight  letters  are  considered  the  entropy  is  roughly  2.3  bits  per  letter,\\nthe  redundancy  about  50 per  cent.\\nSince  then  a  new  method  has  been  found  for  estimating  these  quantities,\\nwhich is more sensitive and takes account of long range statistics, influences\\nextending  over phrases,  sentences,  etc.  This  method  is  based  on  a  study  of\\nthe predictability of English;  how well can the next letter of a  text be pre-\\ndicted when the preceding N letters are known. The results  of some experi-\\nments  in  prediction  will  be  given,  and  a  theoretical  analysis  of  some  of  the\\nproperties of ideal prediction.  By combining the experimental and  theoreti-\\ncal results it is possible  to estimate upper and  lower bounds for the entropy\\nand  redundancy.  From  this  analysis  it  appears  that,  in  ordinary  literary\\nEnglish,  the  long  range  statistical  effects  (up  to  100  letters)  reduce  the\\nentropy  to  something  of  the  order of  one  bit per  letter,  with  a  corresponding\\nredundancy  of  roughly  75%.

This  is  continuec\\nthrough  the text.  As the experiment progresses,  the subject writes down th\\ncorrect  text up  to  the current point for use in predicting future letters.

In  general,  good  prediction  does  not  require  knowl-\\nedge of more  than N preceding letters of text, with N fairly small. There are\\nonly a  finite  number  of  possible  sequences  of  N  letters.  We  could  ask  the\\nsubject to guess the next letter for each of these possible .V-grams. The com-\\nplete  list  of  these  predictions  could  then  be  used  both  for  obtaining  the\\nreduced text from the original and for the inverse reconstruction process.\\nTo  put  this  another  way,  the  reduced  text  can  be  considered  to  be  an\\nencoded form of the original, the result of passing the original  text through\\na  reversible  transducer.  In  fact,  a  communication  system  could  be  con-\\nstructed  in  which  only  the  reduced  text  is  transmitted  from  one  point  to\\nthe other.  This  could  be  set  up  as  shown  in  Fig.  2,  with  two  identical  pre-\\ndiction devices.\\nAn  extension  of  the  above  experiment  yields  further  information  con-\\ncerning the predictability of English. As before,  the subject knows the  text\\nup to the current point and  is asked  to guess  the  next letter.  If he  is wrong,\\nhe is  told  so  and  asked  to  guess  again.  This  is  continued  until  he  finds  the\\ncorrect  letter.  A  typical  result  with  this  experiment  is  shown  below.  The\\n', 9), ('56\\nTHE  BELT.

Newspaper  writing,  scientific  work  and  poetry  generally  lead to\\nsomewhat  poorer  scores.\\nThe  reduced  text  in  this  case  also  contains  the  same  information  as the\\noriginal. Again utilizing the identical twin we ask him at each stage to  guess\\nas many  times  as  the  number  given  in  the  reduced  text  and  recover  in  this\\nway  the  original.  To  eliminate  the  human  element  here  we  must  ask  out\\nsubject,  for  each  possible  .V-gram  of  text,  to  guess  the  most  probable  next\\nletter,  the  second  most probable  next  letter, etc.  This  set  of  data  can  then\\nserve  both  for  prediction  and  recovery.\\nJust as before,  the reduced text can be considered an encoded version of\\nthe  original.  The  original  language,  with  an  alphabet  of  27  symbols,  A,\\nB,  • • •  , Z, space, has been translated into a new language with the alphabet\\n1,  2,  • • •  ,  27. The translating has been such that the symbol 1  now has an\\nextremely  high  frequency.  The  symbols  2,  3,  4  have  successively  smaller\\nfrequencies and the final symbols 20, 21, • • • , 27 occur very rarely. Thus the\\ntranslating has simplified to a considerable extent the nature of the statisti-\\ncal structure involved. The redundancy which  originally appeared in com-\\nplicated constraints among groups of letters, has, by the translating process,\\nbeen made explicit to a large extent in the very unequal probabilities of the\\nnew  symbols. It is this,  as will appear later, which  enables one to estimate\\nthe entropy from these experiments.\\nIn  order  to  determine  how  predictability  depends  on  the  number  .V oi\\npreceding  letters  known  to  the  subject,  a  more  involved  experiment  was\\ncarried out.  One  hundred  samples  of  English  text  were  selected  at  random\\nfrom a book,  each fifteen letters  in length.  The subject was required to  gues<\\nthe  text,  letter  by  letter,  for  each  sample  as  in  the  preceding  experiment.\\nThus one hundred samples were obtained in which the subject had available\\n0,  1,  2,  3,  •  •  •  ,  14  preceding  letters.  To  aid  in  prediction  the  subject  made\\nsuch use as he wished of various statistical tables,  letter,  digram and  trigrair.\\na table of  the frequencies  of  initial  letters  in  words,  a  list  of  the  fre-\\njes of common words and a dictionary.
