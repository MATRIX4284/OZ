Our task was to bring the companyâs\\nrange of middleware products to the OpenShift Container Platform, which was then\\nbeing developed on top of Kubernetes. At that time, Kubernetes was still in its\\ninfancyâversion 1.0 hadnât even been released yet.\\n Our team had to get to know the ins and outs of Kubernetes quickly to set a proper\\ndirection for our software and take advantage of everything Kubernetes had to offer.\\nWhen faced with a problem, it was hard for us to tell if we were doing things wrong or\\nmerely hitting one of the early Kubernetes bugs. \\n Both Kubernetes and my understanding of it have come a long way since then.\\nWhen I first started using it, most people hadnât even heard of Kubernetes. Now, virtu-\\nally every software engineer knows about it, and it has become one of the fastest-\\ngrowing and most-widely-adopted ways of running applications in both the cloud and\\non-premises datacenters. \\n In my first month of dealing with Kubernetes, I wrote a two-part blog post about\\nhow to run a JBoss WildFly application server cluster in OpenShift/Kubernetes. At the\\ntime, I never could have imagined that a simple blog post would ultimately lead the\\npeople at Manning to contact me about whether I would like to write a book about\\nKubernetes. Of course, I couldnât say no to such an offer, even though I was sure\\ntheyâd approached other people as well and would ultimately pick someone else.\\n And yet, here we are. After more than a year and a half of writing and researching,\\nthe book is done. Itâs been an awesome journey. Writing a book about a technology is\\n \\n',\n",

As my knowledge of Kubernetes has expanded during the process and Kuber-\\nnetes itself has evolved, Iâve constantly gone back to previous chapters Iâve written and\\nadded additional information. Iâm a perfectionist, so Iâll never really be absolutely sat-\\nisfied with the book, but Iâm happy to hear that a lot of readers of the Manning Early\\nAccess Program (MEAP) have found it to be a great guide to Kubernetes.\\n My aim is to get the reader to understand the technology itself and teach them\\nhow to use the tooling to effectively and efficiently develop and deploy apps to Kuber-\\nnetes clusters. In the book, I donât put much emphasis on how to actually set up and\\nmaintain a proper highly available Kubernetes cluster, but the last part should give\\nreaders a very solid understanding of what such a cluster consists of and should allow\\nthem to easily comprehend additional resources that deal with this subject.\\n I hope youâll enjoy reading it, and that it teaches you how to get the most out of\\nthe awesome system that is Kubernetes.\\n \\n',\n",

This means\\nthere are a lot of people to thank.\\n First, Iâd like to thank Erin Twohey for approaching me about writing this book,\\nand Michael Stephens from Manning, who had full confidence in my ability to write it\\nfrom day one. His words of encouragement early on really motivated me and kept me\\nmotivated throughout the last year and a half. \\n I would also like to thank my initial development editor Andrew Warren, who\\nhelped me get my first chapter out the door, and Elesha Hyde, who took over from\\nAndrew and worked with me all the way to the last chapter. Thank you for bearing\\nwith me, even though Iâm a difficult person to deal with, as I tend to drop off the\\nradar fairly regularly. \\n I would also like to thank Jeanne Boyarsky, who was the first reviewer to read and\\ncomment on my chapters while I was writing them. Jeanne and Elesha were instrumen-\\ntal in making the book as nice as it hopefully is. Without their comments, the book\\ncould never have received such good reviews from external reviewers and readers.\\n Iâd like to thank my technical proofreader, Antonio Magnaghi, and of course all\\nmy external reviewers: Al Krinker, Alessandro Campeis, Alexander Myltsev, Csaba Sari,\\nDavid DiMaria, Elias Rangel, Erisk Zelenka, Fabrizio Cucci, Jared Duncan, Keith\\nDonaldson, Michael Bright, Paolo Antinori, Peter Perlepes, and Tiklu Ganguly. Their\\npositive comments kept me going at times when I worried my writing was utterly awful\\nand completely useless. On the other hand, their constructive criticism helped improve\\n \\n',\n",

It teaches you\\nvirtually all the concepts you need to understand to effectively develop and run appli-\\ncations in a Kubernetes environment. \\n Before diving into Kubernetes, the book gives an overview of container technolo-\\ngies like Docker, including how to build containers, so that even readers who havenât\\nused these technologies before can get up and running.  It then slowly guides you\\nthrough most of what you need to know about Kubernetesâfrom basic concepts to\\nthings hidden below the surface.\\nWho should read this book\\nThe book focuses primarily on application developers, but it also provides an overview\\nof managing applications from the operational perspective. Itâs meant for anyone\\ninterested in running and managing containerized applications on more than just a\\nsingle server.\\n Both beginner and advanced software engineers who want to learn about con-\\ntainer technologies and orchestrating multiple related containers at scale will gain the\\nexpertise necessary to develop, containerize, and run their applications in a Kuberne-\\ntes environment. \\n No previous exposure to either container technologies or Kubernetes is required.\\nThe book explains the subject matter in a progressively detailed manner, and doesnât\\nuse any application source code that would be too hard for non-expert developers to\\nunderstand. \\n \\n',\n",

It contains two chapters:\\nâ \\nChapter 1 explains what Kubernetes is, how it came to be, and how it helps to\\nsolve todayâs problems of managing applications at scale.\\nâ \\nChapter 2 is a hands-on tutorial on how to build a container image and run it in\\na Kubernetes cluster. It also explains how to run a local single-node Kubernetes\\ncluster and a proper multi-node cluster in the cloud.\\nPart 2 introduces the key concepts you must understand to run applications in Kuber-\\nnetes. The chapters are as follows:\\nâ \\nChapter 3 introduces the fundamental building block in Kubernetesâthe podâ\\nand explains how to organize pods and other Kubernetes objects through labels. \\nâ \\nChapter 4 teaches you how Kubernetes keeps applications healthy by automati-\\ncally restarting containers. It also shows how to properly run managed pods,\\nhorizontally scale them, make them resistant to failures of cluster nodes, and\\nrun them at a predefined time in the future or periodically.\\nâ \\nChapter 5 shows how pods can expose the service they provide to clients run-\\nning both inside and outside the cluster. It also shows how pods running in the\\ncluster can discover and access services, regardless of whether they live in or out\\nof the cluster. \\nâ \\nChapter 6 explains how multiple containers running in the same pod can share\\nfiles and how you can manage persistent storage and make it accessible to pods. \\nâ \\nChapter 7 shows how to pass configuration data and sensitive information like\\ncredentials to apps running inside pods.\\nâ \\nChapter 8 describes how applications can get information about the Kuberne-\\ntes environment theyâre running in and how they can talk to Kubernetes to\\nalter the state of the cluster.\\nâ \\nChapter 9 introduces the concept of a Deployment and explains the proper way\\nof running and updating applications in a Kubernetes environment.\\nâ \\nChapter 10 introduces a dedicated way of running stateful applications, which\\nusually require a stable identity and state.\\nPart 3 dives deep into the internals of a Kubernetes cluster, introduces some addi-\\ntional concepts, and reviews everything youâve learned in the first two parts from a\\nhigher perspective. This is the last group of chapters:\\nâ \\nChapter 11 goes beneath the surface of Kubernetes and explains all the compo-\\nnents that make up a Kubernetes cluster and what each of them does.

This enables you to change components quickly and as often as\\nnecessary to keep up with todayâs rapidly changing business requirements. \\n But with bigger numbers of deployable components and increasingly larger data-\\ncenters, it becomes increasingly difficult to configure, manage, and keep the whole\\nsystem running smoothly. Itâs much harder to figure out where to put each of those\\ncomponents to achieve high resource utilization and thereby keep the hardware costs\\ndown. Doing all this manually is hard work. We need automation, which includes\\nautomatic scheduling of those components to our servers, automatic configuration,\\nsupervision, and failure-handling. This is where Kubernetes comes in.\\n Kubernetes enables developers to deploy their applications themselves and as\\noften as they want, without requiring any assistance from the operations (ops) team.\\nBut Kubernetes doesnât benefit only developers. It also helps the ops team by automat-\\nically monitoring and rescheduling those apps in the event of a hardware failure. The\\nfocus for system administrators (sysadmins) shifts from supervising individual apps to\\nmostly supervising and managing Kubernetes and the rest of the infrastructure, while\\nKubernetes itself takes care of the apps. \\nNOTE\\nKubernetes is Greek for pilot or helmsman (the person holding the\\nshipâs steering wheel). People pronounce Kubernetes in a few different ways.\\nMany pronounce it as Koo-ber-nay-tace, while others pronounce it more like\\nKoo-ber-netties. No matter which form you use, people will understand what\\nyou mean.\\nKubernetes abstracts away the hardware infrastructure and exposes your whole data-\\ncenter as a single enormous computational resource. It allows you to deploy and run\\nyour software components without having to know about the actual servers under-\\nneath. When deploying a multi-component application through Kubernetes, it selects\\na server for each component, deploys it, and enables it to easily find and communi-\\ncate with all the other components of your application. \\n This makes Kubernetes great for most on-premises datacenters, but where it starts\\nto shine is when itâs used in the largest datacenters, such as the ones built and oper-\\nated by cloud providers. Kubernetes allows them to offer developers a simple platform\\nfor deploying and running any type of application, while not requiring the cloud pro-\\nviderâs own sysadmins to know anything about the tens of thousands of apps running\\non their hardware. \\n With more and more big companies accepting the Kubernetes model as the best\\nway to run apps, itâs becoming the standard way of running distributed apps both in\\nthe cloud, as well as on local on-premises infrastructure. \\n1.1\\nUnderstanding the need for a system like Kubernetes \\nBefore you start getting to know Kubernetes in detail, letâs take a quick look at how\\nthe development and deployment of applications has changed in recent years.

Understanding these\\nchanges will help you better see the benefits of using Kubernetes and container tech-\\nnologies such as Docker.\\n1.1.1\\nMoving from monolithic apps to microservices\\nMonolithic applications consist of components that are all tightly coupled together and\\nhave to be developed, deployed, and managed as one entity, because they all run as a sin-\\ngle OS process. Changes to one part of the application require a redeployment of the\\nwhole application, and over time the lack of hard boundaries between the parts results\\nin the increase of complexity and consequential deterioration of the quality of the whole\\nsystem because of the unconstrained growth of inter-dependencies between these parts. \\n Running a monolithic application usually requires a small number of powerful\\nservers that can provide enough resources for running the application. To deal with\\nincreasing loads on the system, you then either have to vertically scale the servers (also\\nknown as scaling up) by adding more CPUs, memory, and other server components,\\nor scale the whole system horizontally, by setting up additional servers and running\\nmultiple copies (or replicas) of an application (scaling out). While scaling up usually\\ndoesnât require any changes to the app, it gets expensive relatively quickly and in prac-\\ntice always has an upper limit. Scaling out, on the other hand, is relatively cheap hard-\\nware-wise, but may require big changes in the application code and isnât always\\npossibleâcertain parts of an application are extremely hard or next to impossible to\\nscale horizontally (relational databases, for example). If any part of a monolithic\\napplication isnât scalable, the whole application becomes unscalable, unless you can\\nsplit up the monolith somehow.\\nSPLITTING APPS INTO MICROSERVICES\\nThese and other problems have forced us to start splitting complex monolithic appli-\\ncations into smaller independently deployable components called microservices.

When the number of those components increases, deployment-related deci-\\nsions become increasingly difficult because not only does the number of deployment\\ncombinations increase, but the number of inter-dependencies between the compo-\\nnents increases by an even greater factor. \\n Microservices perform their work together as a team, so they need to find and talk\\nto each other. When deploying them, someone or something needs to configure all of\\nthem properly to enable them to work together as a single system. With increasing\\nnumbers of microservices, this becomes tedious and error-prone, especially when you\\nconsider what the ops/sysadmin teams need to do when a server fails. \\n Microservices also bring other problems, such as making it hard to debug and trace\\nexecution calls, because they span multiple processes and machines. Luckily, these\\nproblems are now being addressed with distributed tracing systems such as Zipkin. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE DIVERGENCE OF ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS\\nAs Iâve already mentioned, components in a microservices architecture arenât only\\ndeployed independently, but are also developed that way. Because of their indepen-\\ndence and the fact that itâs common to have separate teams developing each compo-\\nnent, nothing impedes each team from using different libraries and replacing them\\nwhenever the need arises. The divergence of dependencies between application com-\\nponents, like the one shown in figure 1.3, where applications require different ver-\\nsions of the same libraries, is inevitable.\\nServer running a monolithic app\\nMonolithic app\\nLibrary B\\nv2.4\\nLibrary C\\nv1.1\\nLibrary A\\nv1.0\\nLibrary Y\\nv3.2\\nLibrary X\\nv1.4\\nServer running multiple apps\\nLibrary B\\nv2.4\\nLibrary C\\nv1.1\\nLibrary C\\nv2.0\\nLibrary A\\nv1.0\\nLibrary A\\nv2.2\\nLibrary Y\\nv4.0\\nLibrary Y\\nv3.2\\nLibrary X\\nv2.3\\nLibrary X\\nv1.4\\nApp 1\\nApp 2\\nApp 3\\nApp 4\\nRequires libraries\\nRequires libraries\\nFigure 1.3\\nMultiple applications running on the same host may have conflicting dependencies.\\n \\n',\n",

The\\nbigger the number of components you need to deploy on the same host, the harder it\\nwill be to manage all their dependencies to satisfy all their requirements. \\n1.1.2\\nProviding a consistent environment to applications\\nRegardless of how many individual components youâre developing and deploying,\\none of the biggest problems that developers and operations teams always have to deal\\nwith is the differences in the environments they run their apps in. Not only is there a\\nhuge difference between development and production environments, differences\\neven exist between individual production machines. Another unavoidable fact is that\\nthe environment of a single production machine will change over time. \\n These differences range from hardware to the operating system to the libraries\\nthat are available on each machine. Production environments are managed by the\\noperations team, while developers often take care of their development laptops on\\ntheir own. The difference is how much these two groups of people know about sys-\\ntem administration, and this understandably leads to relatively big differences\\nbetween those two systems, not to mention that system administrators give much more\\nemphasis on keeping the system up to date with the latest security patches, while a lot\\nof developers donât care about that as much. \\n Also, production systems can run applications from multiple developers or devel-\\nopment teams, which isnât necessarily true for developersâ computers. A production\\nsystem must provide the proper environment to all applications it hosts, even though\\nthey may require different, even conflicting, versions of libraries.\\n To reduce the number of problems that only show up in production, it would be\\nideal if applications could run in the exact same environment during development\\nand in production so they have the exact same operating system, libraries, system con-\\nfiguration, networking environment, and everything else. You also donât want this\\nenvironment to change too much over time, if at all. Also, if possible, you want the\\nability to add applications to the same server without affecting any of the existing\\napplications on that server. \\n1.1.3\\nMoving to continuous delivery: DevOps and NoOps\\nIn the last few years, weâve also seen a shift in the whole application development pro-\\ncess and how applications are taken care of in production. In the past, the develop-\\nment teamâs job was to create the application and hand it off to the operations team,\\nwho then deployed it, tended to it, and kept it running. But now, organizations are\\nrealizing itâs better to have the same team that develops the application also take part\\nin deploying it and taking care of it over its whole lifetime. This means the developer,\\nQA, and operations teams now need to collaborate throughout the whole process.\\nThis practice is called DevOps.\\n \\n',\n",

Ideally, you want developers to deploy the applications them-\\nselves without having to wait for the ops people. But deploying an application often\\nrequires an understanding of the underlying infrastructure and the organization of\\nthe hardware in the datacenter. Developers donât always know those details and, most\\nof the time, donât even want to know about them. \\nLETTING DEVELOPERS AND SYSADMINS DO WHAT THEY DO BEST\\nEven though developers and system administrators both work toward achieving the\\nsame goal of running a successful software application as a service to its customers, they\\nhave different individual goals and motivating factors. Developers love creating new fea-\\ntures and improving the user experience. They donât normally want to be the ones mak-\\ning sure that the underlying operating system is up to date with all the security patches\\nand things like that. They prefer to leave that up to the system administrators. \\n The ops team is in charge of the production deployments and the hardware infra-\\nstructure they run on. They care about system security, utilization, and other aspects\\nthat arenât a high priority for developers. The ops people donât want to deal with the\\nimplicit interdependencies of all the application components and donât want to think\\nabout how changes to either the underlying operating system or the infrastructure\\ncan affect the operation of the application as a whole, but they must.\\n Ideally, you want the developers to deploy applications themselves without know-\\ning anything about the hardware infrastructure and without dealing with the ops\\nteam. This is referred to as NoOps. Obviously, you still need someone to take care of\\nthe hardware infrastructure, but ideally, without having to deal with peculiarities of\\neach application running on it. \\n As youâll see, Kubernetes enables us to achieve all of this. By abstracting away the\\nactual hardware and exposing it as a single platform for deploying and running apps,\\nit allows developers to configure and deploy their applications without any help from\\nthe sysadmins and allows the sysadmins to focus on keeping the underlying infrastruc-\\nture up and running, while not having to know anything about the actual applications\\nrunning on top of it.\\n1.2\\nIntroducing container technologies\\nIn section 1.1 I presented a non-comprehensive list of problems facing todayâs devel-\\nopment and ops teams.

But when these components start getting smaller and their\\nnumbers start to grow, you canât give each of them their own VM if you donât want to\\nwaste hardware resources and keep your hardware costs down. But itâs not only about\\nwasting hardware resources. Because each VM usually needs to be configured and\\nmanaged individually, rising numbers of VMs also lead to wasting human resources,\\nbecause they increase the system administratorsâ workload considerably.\\nISOLATING COMPONENTS WITH LINUX CONTAINER TECHNOLOGIES\\nInstead of using virtual machines to isolate the environments of each microservice (or\\nsoftware processes in general), developers are turning to Linux container technolo-\\ngies. They allow you to run multiple services on the same host machine, while not only\\nexposing a different environment to each of them, but also isolating them from each\\nother, similarly to VMs, but with much less overhead.\\n A process running in a container runs inside the hostâs operating system, like all\\nthe other processes (unlike VMs, where processes run in separate operating sys-\\ntems). But the process in the container is still isolated from other processes. To the\\nprocess itself, it looks like itâs the only one running on the machine and in its oper-\\nating system. \\nCOMPARING VIRTUAL MACHINES TO CONTAINERS\\nCompared to VMs, containers are much more lightweight, which allows you to run\\nhigher numbers of software components on the same hardware, mainly because each\\nVM needs to run its own set of system processes, which requires additional compute\\nresources in addition to those consumed by the componentâs own process. A con-\\ntainer, on the other hand, is nothing more than a single isolated process running in\\nthe host OS, consuming only the resources that the app consumes and without the\\noverhead of any additional processes. \\n Because of the overhead of VMs, you often end up grouping multiple applications\\ninto each VM because you donât have enough resources to dedicate a whole VM to\\neach app. When using containers, you can (and should) have one container for each\\n \\n',\n",

Underneath those VMs\\nis the hostâs OS and a hypervisor, which divides the physical hardware resources into\\nsmaller sets of virtual resources that can be used by the operating system inside each\\nVM.

Two mechanisms make this possible.\\nThe first one, Linux Namespaces, makes sure each process sees its own personal view of\\nthe system (files, processes, network interfaces, hostname, and so on). The second\\none is Linux Control Groups (cgroups), which limit the amount of resources the process\\ncan consume (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and so on).\\nISOLATING PROCESSES WITH LINUX NAMESPACES\\nBy default, each Linux system initially has one single namespace. All system resources,\\nsuch as filesystems, process IDs, user IDs, network interfaces, and others, belong to the\\nsingle namespace. But you can create additional namespaces and organize resources\\nacross them. When running a process, you run it inside one of those namespaces. The\\nprocess will only see resources that are inside the same namespace. Well, multiple\\nkinds of namespaces exist, so a process doesnât belong to one namespace, but to one\\nnamespace of each kind. \\n The following kinds of namespaces exist:\\n\\uf0a1Mount (mnt)\\n\\uf0a1Process ID (pid)\\n\\uf0a1Network (net)\\n\\uf0a1Inter-process communication (ipc)\\n\\uf0a1UTS\\n\\uf0a1User ID (user)\\nEach namespace kind is used to isolate a certain group of resources. For example, the\\nUTS namespace determines what hostname and domain name the process running\\ninside that namespace sees. By assigning two different UTS namespaces to a pair of\\nprocesses, you can make them see different local hostnames. In other words, to the\\ntwo processes, it will appear as though they are running on two different machines (at\\nleast as far as the hostname is concerned). \\n Likewise, what Network namespace a process belongs to determines which net-\\nwork interfaces the application running inside the process sees. Each network inter-\\nface belongs to exactly one namespace, but can be moved from one namespace to\\nanother. Each container uses its own Network namespace, and therefore each con-\\ntainer sees its own set of network interfaces.\\n This should give you a basic idea of how namespaces are used to isolate applica-\\ntions running in containers from each other. \\nLIMITING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO A PROCESS\\nThe other half of container isolation deals with limiting the amount of system\\nresources a container can consume. This is achieved with cgroups, a Linux kernel fea-\\nture that limits the resource usage of a process (or a group of processes). A process\\ncanât use more than the configured amount of CPU, memory, network bandwidth,\\n \\n',\n",

This way, processes cannot hog resources reserved for other processes,\\nwhich is similar to when each process runs on a separate machine.\\n1.2.2\\nIntroducing the Docker container platform\\nWhile container technologies have been around for a long time, theyâve become\\nmore widely known with the rise of the Docker container platform. Docker was the\\nfirst container system that made containers easily portable across different machines.\\nIt simplified the process of packaging up not only the application but also all its\\nlibraries and other dependencies, even the whole OS file system, into a simple, por-\\ntable package that can be used to provision the application to any other machine\\nrunning Docker. \\n When you run an application packaged with Docker, it sees the exact filesystem\\ncontents that youâve bundled with it. It sees the same files whether itâs running on\\nyour development machine or a production machine, even if it the production server\\nis running a completely different Linux OS. The application wonât see anything from\\nthe server itâs running on, so it doesnât matter if the server has a completely different\\nset of installed libraries compared to your development machine. \\n For example, if youâve packaged up your application with the files of the whole\\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system, the application will believe itâs\\nrunning inside RHEL, both when you run it on your development computer that runs\\nFedora and when you run it on a server running Debian or some other Linux distribu-\\ntion. Only the kernel may be different.\\n This is similar to creating a VM image by installing an operating system into a VM,\\ninstalling the app inside it, and then distributing the whole VM image around and\\nrunning it. Docker achieves the same effect, but instead of using VMs to achieve app\\nisolation, it uses Linux container technologies mentioned in the previous section to\\nprovide (almost) the same level of isolation that VMs do. Instead of using big mono-\\nlithic VM images, it uses container images, which are usually smaller.\\n A big difference between Docker-based container images and VM images is that\\ncontainer images are composed of layers, which can be shared and reused across mul-\\ntiple images. This means only certain layers of an image need to be downloaded if the\\nother layers were already downloaded previously when running a different container\\nimage that also contains the same layers.\\nUNDERSTANDING DOCKER CONCEPTS\\nDocker is a platform for packaging, distributing, and running applications. As weâve\\nalready stated, it allows you to package your application together with its whole envi-\\nronment. This can be either a few libraries that the app requires or even all the files\\nthat are usually available on the filesystem of an installed operating system. Docker\\nmakes it possible to transfer this package to a central repository from which it can\\nthen be transferred to any computer running Docker and executed there (for the\\nmost part, but not always, as weâll soon explain).\\n \\n',\n",

It contains the filesystem that will be available\\nto the application and other metadata, such as the path to the executable that\\nshould be executed when the image is run. \\n\\uf0a1RegistriesâA Docker Registry is a repository that stores your Docker images and\\nfacilitates easy sharing of those images between different people and comput-\\ners. When you build your image, you can either run it on the computer youâve\\nbuilt it on, or you can push (upload) the image to a registry and then pull\\n(download) it on another computer and run it there. Certain registries are pub-\\nlic, allowing anyone to pull images from it, while others are private, only accessi-\\nble to certain people or machines.\\n\\uf0a1ContainersâA Docker-based container is a regular Linux container created from\\na Docker-based container image. A running container is a process running on\\nthe host running Docker, but itâs completely isolated from both the host and all\\nother processes running on it.

How can both app A and app B\\nshare the same files?\\nUNDERSTANDING IMAGE LAYERS\\nIâve already said that Docker images are composed of layers. Different images can con-\\ntain the exact same layers because every Docker image is built on top of another\\nimage and two different images can both use the same parent image as their base.\\nThis speeds up the distribution of images across the network, because layers that have\\nalready been transferred as part of the first image donât need to be transferred again\\nwhen transferring the other image. \\n But layers donât only make distribution more efficient, they also help reduce the\\nstorage footprint of images. Each layer is only stored once. Two containers created\\nfrom two images based on the same base layers can therefore read the same files, but\\nif one of them writes over those files, the other one doesnât see those changes. There-\\nfore, even if they share files, theyâre still isolated from each other. This works because\\ncontainer image layers are read-only. When a container is run, a new writable layer is\\ncreated on top of the layers in the image. When the process in the container writes to\\na file located in one of the underlying layers, a copy of the whole file is created in the\\ntop-most layer and the process writes to the copy. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE PORTABILITY LIMITATIONS OF CONTAINER IMAGES\\nIn theory, a container image can be run on any Linux machine running Docker, but\\none small caveat existsâone related to the fact that all containers running on a host use\\nthe hostâs Linux kernel. If a containerized application requires a specific kernel version,\\nit may not work on every machine. If a machine runs a different version of the Linux\\nkernel or doesnât have the same kernel modules available, the app canât run on it.\\n While containers are much more lightweight compared to VMs, they impose cer-\\ntain constraints on the apps running inside them. VMs have no such constraints,\\nbecause each VM runs its own kernel. \\n And itâs not only about the kernel. It should also be clear that a containerized app\\nbuilt for a specific hardware architecture can only run on other machines that have\\nthe same architecture. You canât containerize an application built for the x86 architec-\\nture and expect it to run on an ARM-based machine because it also runs Docker. You\\nstill need a VM for that.\\n1.2.3\\nIntroducing rktâan alternative to Docker\\nDocker was the first container platform that made containers mainstream. I hope Iâve\\nmade it clear that Docker itself doesnât provide process isolation. The actual isolation\\nof containers is done at the Linux kernel level using kernel features such as Linux\\nNamespaces and cgroups. Docker only makes it easy to use those features.\\n After the success of Docker, the Open Container Initiative (OCI) was born to cre-\\nate open industry standards around container formats and runtime. Docker is part\\nof that initiative, as is rkt (pronounced ârock-itâ), which is another Linux container\\nengine. \\n \\n',\n",

It puts a strong emphasis on\\nsecurity, composability, and conforming to open standards. It uses the OCI container\\nimage format and can even run regular Docker container images. \\n This book focuses on using Docker as the container runtime for Kubernetes,\\nbecause it was initially the only one supported by Kubernetes. Recently, Kubernetes\\nhas also started supporting rkt, as well as others, as the container runtime. \\n The reason I mention rkt at this point is so you donât make the mistake of thinking\\nKubernetes is a container orchestration system made specifically for Docker-based\\ncontainers. In fact, over the course of this book, youâll realize that the essence of\\nKubernetes isnât orchestrating containers. Itâs much more. Containers happen to be\\nthe best way to run apps on different cluster nodes. With that in mind, letâs finally dive\\ninto the core of what this book is all aboutâKubernetes.\\n1.3\\nIntroducing Kubernetes\\nWeâve already shown that as the number of deployable application components in\\nyour system grows, it becomes harder to manage them all. Google was probably the\\nfirst company that realized it needed a much better way of deploying and managing\\ntheir software components and their infrastructure to scale globally. Itâs one of only a\\nfew companies in the world that runs hundreds of thousands of servers and has had to\\ndeal with managing deployments on such a massive scale. This has forced them to\\ndevelop solutions for making the development and deployment of thousands of soft-\\nware components manageable and cost-efficient.\\n1.3.1\\nUnderstanding its origins\\nThrough the years, Google developed an internal system called Borg (and later a new\\nsystem called Omega), that helped both application developers and system administra-\\ntors manage those thousands of applications and services. In addition to simplifying\\nthe development and management, it also helped them achieve a much higher utiliza-\\ntion of their infrastructure, which is important when your organization is that large.\\nWhen you run hundreds of thousands of machines, even tiny improvements in utiliza-\\ntion mean savings in the millions of dollars, so the incentives for developing such a\\nsystem are clear.\\n After having kept Borg and Omega secret for a whole decade, in 2014 Google\\nintroduced Kubernetes, an open-source system based on the experience gained\\nthrough Borg, Omega, and other internal Google systems. \\n1.3.2\\nLooking at Kubernetes from the top of a mountain\\nKubernetes is a software system that allows you to easily deploy and manage container-\\nized applications on top of it. It relies on the features of Linux containers to run het-\\nerogeneous applications without having to know any internal details of these\\napplications and without having to manually deploy these applications on each host.\\nBecause these apps run in containers, they donât affect other apps running on the\\n \\n',\n",

This is of paramount importance for cloud provid-\\ners, because they strive for the best possible utilization of their hardware while still\\nhaving to maintain complete isolation of hosted applications.\\n Kubernetes enables you to run your software applications on thousands of com-\\nputer nodes as if all those nodes were a single, enormous computer. It abstracts away\\nthe underlying infrastructure and, by doing so, simplifies development, deployment,\\nand management for both development and the operations teams. \\n Deploying applications through Kubernetes is always the same, whether your clus-\\nter contains only a couple of nodes or thousands of them. The size of the cluster\\nmakes no difference at all. Additional cluster nodes simply represent an additional\\namount of resources available to deployed apps.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE CORE OF WHAT KUBERNETES DOES\\nFigure 1.8 shows the simplest possible view of a Kubernetes system. The system is com-\\nposed of a master node and any number of worker nodes. When the developer sub-\\nmits a list of apps to the master, Kubernetes deploys them to the cluster of worker\\nnodes. What node a component lands on doesnât (and shouldnât) matterâneither to\\nthe developer nor to the system administrator.\\nThe developer can specify that certain apps must run together and Kubernetes will\\ndeploy them on the same worker node. Others will be spread around the cluster, but\\nthey can talk to each other in the same way, regardless of where theyâre deployed.\\nHELPING DEVELOPERS FOCUS ON THE CORE APP FEATURES\\nKubernetes can be thought of as an operating system for the cluster. It relieves appli-\\ncation developers from having to implement certain infrastructure-related services\\ninto their apps; instead they rely on Kubernetes to provide these services.

If one of those instances stops working\\nproperly, like when its process crashes or when it stops responding, Kubernetes will\\nrestart it automatically. \\n Similarly, if a whole worker node dies or becomes inaccessible, Kubernetes will\\nselect new nodes for all the containers that were running on the node and run them\\non the newly selected nodes.\\nSCALING THE NUMBER OF COPIES\\nWhile the application is running, you can decide you want to increase or decrease the\\nnumber of copies, and Kubernetes will spin up additional ones or stop the excess\\nones, respectively.

The kube-proxy will make sure connec-\\ntions to the service are load balanced across all the containers that provide the service.\\nThe IP address of the service stays constant, so clients can always connect to its con-\\ntainers, even when theyâre moved around the cluster.\\n1.3.5\\nUnderstanding the benefits of using Kubernetes\\nIf you have Kubernetes deployed on all your servers, the ops team doesnât need to\\ndeal with deploying your apps anymore. Because a containerized application already\\ncontains all it needs to run, the system administrators donât need to install anything to\\ndeploy and run the app. On any node where Kubernetes is deployed, Kubernetes can\\nrun the app immediately without any help from the sysadmins. \\nSIMPLIFYING APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT\\nBecause Kubernetes exposes all its worker nodes as a single deployment platform,\\napplication developers can start deploying applications on their own and donât need\\nto know anything about the servers that make up the cluster. \\n \\n',\n",

A developer doesnât usually care what\\nkind of server the application is running on, as long as the server can provide the\\napplication with adequate system resources. \\n Certain cases do exist where the developer does care what kind of hardware the\\napplication should run on. If the nodes are heterogeneous, youâll find cases when you\\nwant certain apps to run on nodes with certain capabilities and run other apps on oth-\\ners. For example, one of your apps may require being run on a system with SSDs\\ninstead of HDDs, while other apps run fine on HDDs. In such cases, you obviously\\nwant to ensure that particular app is always scheduled to a node with an SSD.\\n Without using Kubernetes, the sysadmin would select one specific node that has an\\nSSD and deploy the app there. But when using Kubernetes, instead of selecting a spe-\\ncific node where your app should be run, itâs more appropriate to tell Kubernetes to\\nonly choose among nodes with an SSD. Youâll learn how to do that in chapter 3.\\nACHIEVING BETTER UTILIZATION OF HARDWARE\\nBy setting up Kubernetes on your servers and using it to run your apps instead of run-\\nning them manually, youâve decoupled your app from the infrastructure. When you\\ntell Kubernetes to run your application, youâre letting it choose the most appropriate\\nnode to run your application on based on the description of the applicationâs\\nresource requirements and the available resources on each node. \\n By using containers and not tying the app down to a specific node in your cluster,\\nyouâre allowing the app to freely move around the cluster at any time, so the different\\napp components running on the cluster can be mixed and matched to be packed\\ntightly onto the cluster nodes. This ensures the nodeâs hardware resources are utilized\\nas best as possible.\\n The ability to move applications around the cluster at any time allows Kubernetes\\nto utilize the infrastructure much better than what you can achieve manually. Humans\\narenât good at finding optimal combinations, especially when the number of all possi-\\nble options is huge, such as when you have many application components and many\\nserver nodes they can be deployed on. Computers can obviously perform this work\\nmuch better and faster than humans. \\nHEALTH CHECKING AND SELF-HEALING\\nHaving a system that allows moving an application across the cluster at any time is also\\nvaluable in the event of server failures. As your cluster size increases, youâll deal with\\nfailing computer components ever more frequently. \\n Kubernetes monitors your app components and the nodes they run on and auto-\\nmatically reschedules them to other nodes in the event of a node failure. This frees\\nthe ops team from having to migrate app components manually and allows the team\\nto immediately focus on fixing the node itself and returning it to the pool of available\\nhardware resources instead of focusing on relocating the app.\\n If your infrastructure has enough spare resources to allow normal system opera-\\ntion even without the failed node, the ops team doesnât even need to react to the failure\\n \\n',\n",

As previously mentioned, Kubernetes can be told to monitor the\\nresources used by each application and to keep adjusting the number of running\\ninstances of each application. \\n If Kubernetes is running on cloud infrastructure, where adding additional nodes is\\nas easy as requesting them through the cloud providerâs API, Kubernetes can even\\nautomatically scale the whole cluster size up or down based on the needs of the\\ndeployed applications.\\nSIMPLIFYING APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT\\nThe features described in the previous section mostly benefit the operations team. But\\nwhat about the developers? Does Kubernetes bring anything to their table? It defi-\\nnitely does.\\n If you turn back to the fact that apps run in the same environment both during\\ndevelopment and in production, this has a big effect on when bugs are discovered. We\\nall agree the sooner you discover a bug, the easier it is to fix it, and fixing it requires\\nless work. Itâs the developers who do the fixing, so this means less work for them. \\n Then thereâs the fact that developers donât need to implement features that they\\nwould usually implement. This includes discovery of services and/or peers in a clustered\\napplication. Kubernetes does this instead of the app. Usually, the app only needs to look\\nup certain environment variables or perform a DNS lookup. If thatâs not enough, the\\napplication can query the Kubernetes API server directly to get that and/or other infor-\\nmation. Querying the Kubernetes API server like that can even save developers from\\nhaving to implement complicated mechanisms such as leader election.\\n As a final example of what Kubernetes brings to the table, you also need to con-\\nsider the increase in confidence developers will feel knowing that when a new version\\nof their app is going to be rolled out, Kubernetes can automatically detect if the new\\nversion is bad and stop its rollout immediately. This increase in confidence usually\\naccelerates the continuous delivery of apps, which benefits the whole organization.\\n1.4\\nSummary\\nIn this introductory chapter, youâve seen how applications have changed in recent\\nyears and how they can now be harder to deploy and manage. Weâve introduced\\nKubernetes and shown how it, together with Docker and other container platforms,\\nhelps deploy and manage applications and the infrastructure they run on.

In the next few sections youâll\\n1\\nInstall Docker and run your first âHello worldâ container \\n2\\nCreate a trivial Node.js app that youâll later deploy in Kubernetes\\n3\\nPackage the app into a container image so you can then run it as an isolated\\ncontainer\\n4\\nRun a container based on the image\\n5\\nPush the image to Docker Hub so that anyone anywhere can run it\\n2.1.1\\nInstalling Docker and running a Hello World container\\nFirst, youâll need to install Docker on your Linux machine. If you donât use Linux,\\nyouâll need to start a Linux virtual machine (VM) and run Docker inside that VM. If\\nyouâre using a Mac or Windows and install Docker per instructions, Docker will set up\\na VM for you and run the Docker daemon inside that VM. The Docker client execut-\\nable will be available on your host OS, and will communicate with the daemon inside\\nthe VM. \\n To install Docker, follow the instructions at http:/\\n/docs.docker.com/engine/\\ninstallation/ for your specific operating system. After completing the installation, you\\ncan use the Docker client executable to run various Docker commands. For example,\\nyou could try pulling and running an existing image from Docker Hub, the public\\nDocker registry, which contains ready-to-use container images for many well-known\\nsoftware packages. One of them is the busybox image, which youâll use to run a simple\\necho \"Hello world\" command. \\nRUNNING A HELLO WORLD CONTAINER\\nIf youâre unfamiliar with busybox, itâs a single executable that combines many of the\\nstandard UNIX command-line tools, such as echo, ls, gzip, and so on. Instead of the\\nbusybox image, you could also use any other full-fledged OS container image such as\\nFedora, Ubuntu, or other similar images, as long as it includes the echo executable.\\n How do you run the busybox image? You donât need to download or install any-\\nthing. Use the docker run command and specify what image to download and run\\nand (optionally) what command to execute, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ docker run busybox echo \"Hello world\"\\nUnable to find image \\'busybox:latest\\' locally\\nlatest: Pulling from docker.io/busybox\\n9a163e0b8d13: Pull complete \\nfef924a0204a: Pull complete\\nDigest: sha256:97473e34e311e6c1b3f61f2a721d038d1e5eef17d98d1353a513007cf46ca6bd\\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for docker.io/busybox:latest\\nHello world\\nListing 2.1\\nRunning a Hello world container with Docker\\n \\n',\n",

In your case, the app was a single execut-\\nable (busybox), but it might as well have been an incredibly complex app with many\\ndependencies. The whole process of setting up and running the app would have been\\nexactly the same. Whatâs also important is that the app was executed inside a container,\\ncompletely isolated from all the other processes running on your machine.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENS BEHIND THE SCENES\\nFigure 2.1 shows exactly what happened when you performed the docker run com-\\nmand. First, Docker checked to see if the busybox:latest image was already present\\non your local machine. It wasnât, so Docker pulled it from the Docker Hub registry at\\nhttp:/\\n/docker.io. After the image was downloaded to your machine, Docker created a\\ncontainer from that image and ran the command inside it. The echo command\\nprinted the text to STDOUT and then the process terminated and the container\\nstopped.\\nRUNNING OTHER IMAGES\\nRunning other existing container images is much the same as how you ran the busybox\\nimage. In fact, itâs often even simpler, because you usually donât need to specify what\\ncommand to execute, the way you did in the example (echo \"Hello world\"). The\\ncommand that should be executed is usually baked into the image itself, but you can\\noverride it if you want. After searching or browsing through the publicly available\\nimages on http:/\\n/hub.docker.com or another public registry, you tell Docker to run\\nthe image like this:\\n$ docker run <image>\\nFigure 2.1\\nRunning echo âHello worldâ in a container based on the busybox container image\\nLocal machine\\nDocker Hub\\n1. docker run busybox\\necho \"Hello world\"\\n3.

Docker supports having multiple versions or variants of the same image under\\nthe same name. Each variant must have a unique tag. When referring to images with-\\nout explicitly specifying the tag, Docker will assume youâre referring to the so-called\\nlatest tag. To run a different version of the image, you may specify the tag along with\\nthe image name like this:\\n$ docker run <image>:<tag>\\n2.1.2\\nCreating a trivial Node.js app\\nNow that you have a working Docker setup, youâre going to create an app. Youâll build\\na trivial Node.js web application and package it into a container image. The applica-\\ntion will accept HTTP requests and respond with the hostname of the machine itâs\\nrunning in. This way, youâll see that an app running inside a container sees its own\\nhostname and not that of the host machine, even though itâs running on the host like\\nany other process. This will be useful later, when you deploy the app on Kubernetes\\nand scale it out (scale it horizontally; that is, run multiple instances of the app). Youâll\\nsee your HTTP requests hitting different instances of the app.\\n Your app will consist of a single file called app.js with the contents shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\nconst http = require(\\'http\\');\\nconst os = require(\\'os\\');\\nconsole.log(\"Kubia server starting...\");\\nvar handler = function(request, response) {\\n  console.log(\"Received request from \" + request.connection.remoteAddress);\\n  response.writeHead(200);\\n  response.end(\"You\\'ve hit \" + os.hostname() + \"\\\\n\");\\n};\\nvar www = http.createServer(handler);\\nwww.listen(8080);\\nIt should be clear what this code does. It starts up an HTTP server on port 8080. The\\nserver responds with an HTTP response status code 200 OK and the text \"Youâve hit\\n<hostname>\" to every request. The request handler also logs the clientâs IP address to\\nthe standard output, which youâll need later.\\nNOTE\\nThe returned hostname is the serverâs actual hostname, not the one\\nthe client sends in the HTTP requestâs Host header.\\nYou could now download and install Node.js and test your app directly, but this isnât\\nnecessary, because youâll use Docker to package the app into a container image and\\nListing 2.2\\nA simple Node.js app: app.js\\n \\n',\n",

The Dockerfile needs to be in the same directory as the app.js file and should\\ncontain the commands shown in the following listing.\\nFROM node:7\\nADD app.js /app.js\\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\\nThe FROM line defines the container image youâll use as a starting point (the base\\nimage youâre building on top of). In your case, youâre using the node container image,\\ntag 7. In the second line, youâre adding your app.js file from your local directory into\\nthe root directory in the image, under the same name (app.js). Finally, in the third\\nline, youâre defining what command should be executed when somebody runs the\\nimage. In your case, the command is node app.js.\\n2.1.4\\nBuilding the container image\\nNow that you have your Dockerfile and the app.js file, you have everything you need\\nto build your image. To build it, run the following Docker command:\\n$ docker build -t kubia .\\nFigure 2.2 shows what happens during the build process. Youâre telling Docker to\\nbuild an image called kubia based on the contents of the current directory (note the\\ndot at the end of the build command). Docker will look for the Dockerfile in the direc-\\ntory and build the image based on the instructions in the file.\\nListing 2.3\\nA Dockerfile for building a container image for your app\\nChoosing a base image\\nYou may wonder why we chose this specific image as your base. Because your app\\nis a Node.js app, you need your image to contain the node binary executable to run\\nthe app. You could have used any image that contains that binary, or you could have\\neven used a Linux distro base image such as fedora or ubuntu and installed\\nNode.js into the container at image build time. But because the node image is made\\nspecifically for running Node.js apps, and includes everything you need to run your\\napp, youâll use that as the base image.\\n \\n',\n",

Instead, the contents of the\\nwhole directory are uploaded to the Docker daemon and the image is built there.\\nThe client and daemon donât need to be on the same machine at all. If youâre using\\nDocker on a non-Linux OS, the client is on your host OS, but the daemon runs\\ninside a VM. Because all the files in the build directory are uploaded to the daemon,\\nif it contains many large files and the daemon isnât running locally, the upload may\\ntake longer. \\nTIP\\nDonât include any unnecessary files in the build directory, because theyâll\\nslow down the build processâespecially when the Docker daemon is on a\\nremote machine. \\nDuring the build process, Docker will first pull the base image (node:7) from the pub-\\nlic image repository (Docker Hub), unless the image has already been pulled and is\\nstored on your machine. \\nUNDERSTANDING IMAGE LAYERS\\nAn image isnât a single, big, binary blob, but is composed of multiple layers, which you\\nmay have already noticed when running the busybox example (there were multiple\\nPull complete linesâone for each layer).

For example, if\\nyou create multiple images based on the same base image (such as node:7 in the exam-\\nple), all the layers comprising the base image will be stored only once. Also, when pull-\\ning an image, Docker will download each layer individually. Several layers may already\\nbe stored on your machine, so Docker will only download those that arenât.\\n You may think that each Dockerfile creates only a single new layer, but thatâs not\\nthe case. When building an image, a new layer is created for each individual command\\nin the Dockerfile. During the build of your image, after pulling all the layers of the base\\nimage, Docker will create a new layer on top of them and add the app.js file into it.\\nThen it will create yet another layer that will specify the command that should be exe-\\ncuted when the image is run.

Because\\nmultiple processes can run inside the same container, you can always run an addi-\\ntional process in it to see whatâs inside. You can even run a shell, provided that the\\nshellâs binary executable is available in the image. \\nRUNNING A SHELL INSIDE AN EXISTING CONTAINER\\nThe Node.js image on which youâve based your image contains the bash shell, so you\\ncan run the shell inside the container like this:\\n$ docker exec -it kubia-container bash\\nThis will run bash inside the existing kubia-container container. The bash process\\nwill have the same Linux namespaces as the main container process. This allows you\\nto explore the container from within and see how Node.js and your app see the system\\nwhen running inside the container. The -it option is shorthand for two options: \\n\\uf0a1\\n-i, which makes sure STDIN is kept open. You need this for entering com-\\nmands into the shell. \\n\\uf0a1\\n-t, which allocates a pseudo terminal (TTY).\\nYou need both if you want the use the shell like youâre used to. (If you leave out the\\nfirst one, you canât type any commands, and if you leave out the second one, the com-\\nmand prompt wonât be displayed and some commands will complain about the TERM\\nvariable not being set.)\\nEXPLORING THE CONTAINER FROM WITHIN\\nLetâs see how to use the shell in the following listing to see the processes running in\\nthe container.\\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ps aux\\nUSER  PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND\\nroot    1  0.0  0.1 676380 16504 ?

Sl   12:31 0:00 node app.js\\nThis proves that processes running in the container are running in the host OS. If you\\nhave a keen eye, you may have noticed that the processes have different IDs inside the\\ncontainer vs. on the host. The container is using its own PID Linux namespace and\\nhas a completely isolated process tree, with its own sequence of numbers. \\nTHE CONTAINERâS FILESYSTEM IS ALSO ISOLATED\\nLike having an isolated process tree, each container also has an isolated filesystem.\\nListing the contents of the root directory inside the container will only show the files\\nin the container and will include all the files that are in the image plus any files that\\nare created while the container is running (log files and similar), as shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\nroot@44d76963e8e1:/# ls /\\napp.js  boot  etc   lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr\\nbin     dev   home  lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var\\nIt contains the app.js file and other system directories that are part of the node:7 base\\nimage youâre using. To exit the container, you exit the shell by running the exit com-\\nmand and youâll be returned to your host machine (like logging out of an ssh session,\\nfor example).\\nTIP\\nEntering a running container like this is useful when debugging an app\\nrunning in a container. When somethingâs wrong, the first thing youâll want\\nto explore is the actual state of the system your application sees. Keep in mind\\nthat an application will not only see its own unique filesystem, but also pro-\\ncesses, users, hostname, and network interfaces.\\n2.1.7\\nStopping and removing a container\\nTo stop your app, you tell Docker to stop the kubia-container container:\\n$ docker stop kubia-container\\nListing 2.7\\nA containerâs processes run in the host OS\\nListing 2.8\\nA container has its own complete filesystem\\n \\n',\n",

The con-\\ntainer itself still exists and you can see it with docker ps -a. The -a option prints out\\nall the containers, those running and those that have been stopped. To truly remove a\\ncontainer, you need to remove it with the docker rm command:\\n$ docker rm kubia-container\\nThis deletes the container. All its contents are removed and it canât be started again.\\n2.1.8\\nPushing the image to an image registry\\nThe image youâve built has so far only been available on your local machine. To allow\\nyou to run it on any other machine, you need to push the image to an external image\\nregistry. For the sake of simplicity, you wonât set up a private image registry and will\\ninstead push the image to Docker Hub (http:/\\n/hub.docker.com), which is one of the\\npublicly available registries. Other widely used such registries are Quay.io and the\\nGoogle Container Registry.\\n Before you do that, you need to re-tag your image according to Docker Hubâs\\nrules. Docker Hub will allow you to push an image if the imageâs repository name\\nstarts with your Docker Hub ID. You create your Docker Hub ID by registering at\\nhttp:/\\n/hub.docker.com. Iâll use my own ID (luksa) in the following examples. Please\\nchange every occurrence with your own ID.\\nTAGGING AN IMAGE UNDER AN ADDITIONAL TAG\\nOnce you know your ID, youâre ready to rename your image, currently tagged as\\nkubia, to luksa/kubia (replace luksa with your own Docker Hub ID):\\n$ docker tag kubia luksa/kubia\\nThis doesnât rename the tag; it creates an additional tag for the same image. You can\\nconfirm this by listing the images stored on your system with the docker images com-\\nmand, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ docker images | head\\nREPOSITORY        TAG      IMAGE ID        CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE\\nluksa/kubia       latest   d30ecc7419e7    About an hour ago   654.5 MB\\nkubia             latest   d30ecc7419e7    About an hour ago   654.5 MB\\ndocker.io/node    7.0      04c0ca2a8dad    2 days ago          654.5 MB\\n...\\nAs you can see, both kubia and luksa/kubia point to the same image ID, so theyâre in\\nfact one single image with two tags. \\nListing 2.9\\nA container image can have multiple tags\\n \\n',\n",

Once youâre logged in, you can finally push the\\nyourid/kubia image to Docker Hub like this:\\n$ docker push luksa/kubia\\nRUNNING THE IMAGE ON A DIFFERENT MACHINE\\nAfter the push to Docker Hub is complete, the image will be available to everyone.\\nYou can now run the image on any machine running Docker by executing the follow-\\ning command:\\n$ docker run -p 8080:8080 -d luksa/kubia\\nIt doesnât get much simpler than that. And the best thing about this is that your appli-\\ncation will have the exact same environment every time and everywhere itâs run. If it\\nran fine on your machine, it should run as well on every other Linux machine. No\\nneed to worry about whether the host machine has Node.js installed or not. In fact,\\neven if it does, your app wonât use it, because it will use the one installed inside the\\nimage.\\n2.2\\nSetting up a Kubernetes cluster\\nNow that you have your app packaged inside a container image and made available\\nthrough Docker Hub, you can deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster instead of running it\\nin Docker directly. But first, you need to set up the cluster itself. \\n Setting up a full-fledged, multi-node Kubernetes cluster isnât a simple task, espe-\\ncially if youâre not well-versed in Linux and networking administration. A proper\\nKubernetes install spans multiple physical or virtual machines and requires the net-\\nworking to be set up properly, so that all the containers running inside the Kuberne-\\ntes cluster can connect to each other through the same flat networking space. \\n A long list of methods exists for installing a Kubernetes cluster. These methods are\\ndescribed in detail in the documentation at http:/\\n/kubernetes.io. Weâre not going to\\nlist all of them here, because the list keeps evolving, but Kubernetes can be run on\\nyour local development machine, your own organizationâs cluster of machines, on\\ncloud providers providing virtual machines (Google Compute Engine, Amazon EC2,\\nMicrosoft Azure, and so on), or by using a managed Kubernetes cluster such as Goo-\\ngle Kubernetes Engine (previously known as Google Container Engine). \\n In this chapter, weâll cover two simple options for getting your hands on a running\\nKubernetes cluster. Youâll see how to run a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your\\nlocal machine and how to get access to a hosted cluster running on Google Kuberne-\\ntes Engine (GKE). \\n A third option, which covers installing a cluster with the kubeadm tool, is explained\\nin appendix B.

It\\nhelps you deploy production-grade, highly available Kubernetes clusters on AWS and\\nwill eventually support other platforms as well (Google Kubernetes Engine, VMware,\\nvSphere, and so on).\\n2.2.1\\nRunning a local single-node Kubernetes cluster with Minikube\\nThe simplest and quickest path to a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster is by using\\nMinikube. Minikube is a tool that sets up a single-node cluster thatâs great for both\\ntesting Kubernetes and developing apps locally. \\n Although we canât show certain Kubernetes features related to managing apps on\\nmultiple nodes, the single-node cluster should be enough for exploring most topics\\ndiscussed in this book. \\nINSTALLING MINIKUBE\\nMinikube is a single binary that needs to be downloaded and put onto your path. Itâs\\navailable for OSX, Linux, and Windows. To install it, the best place to start is to go to\\nthe Minikube repository on GitHub (http:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/minikube) and\\nfollow the instructions there.\\n For example, on OSX and Linux, Minikube can be downloaded and set up with a\\nsingle command. For OSX, this is what the command looks like:\\n$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/\\nâ¥ v0.23.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 && chmod +x minikube && sudo mv minikube \\nâ¥ /usr/local/bin/\\nOn Linux, you download a different release (replace âdarwinâ with âlinuxâ in the\\nURL). On Windows, you can download the file manually, rename it to minikube.exe,\\nand put it onto your path. Minikube runs Kubernetes inside a VM run through either\\nVirtualBox or KVM, so you also need to install one of them before you can start the\\nMinikube cluster.\\nSTARTING A KUBERNETES CLUSTER WITH MINIKUBE\\nOnce you have Minikube installed locally, you can immediately start up the Kuberne-\\ntes cluster with the command in the following listing.\\n$ minikube start\\nStarting local Kubernetes cluster...\\nStarting VM...\\nSSH-ing files into VM...\\n...\\nKubectl is now configured to use the cluster. \\nListing 2.10\\nStarting a Minikube virtual machine\\n \\n',\n",

Again, all you need\\nto do is download it and put it on your path. The latest stable release for OSX, for\\nexample, can be downloaded and installed with the following command:\\n$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\\nâ¥  /$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\\nâ¥  /stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl \\nâ¥  && chmod +x kubectl \\nâ¥  && sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/\\nTo download kubectl for Linux or Windows, replace darwin in the URL with either\\nlinux or windows.\\nNOTE\\nIf youâll be using multiple Kubernetes clusters (for example, both\\nMinikube and GKE), refer to appendix A for information on how to set up\\nand switch between different kubectl contexts.\\nCHECKING TO SEE THE CLUSTER IS UP AND KUBECTL CAN TALK TO IT\\nTo verify your cluster is working, you can use the kubectl cluster-info command\\nshown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl cluster-info\\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443\\nKubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/proxy/...\\nkubernetes-dashboard is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/...\\nThis shows the cluster is up.

For example, you may want to see what processes are run-\\nning on the node.\\n2.2.2\\nUsing a hosted Kubernetes cluster with Google Kubernetes Engine\\nIf you want to explore a full-fledged multi-node Kubernetes cluster instead, you can\\nuse a managed Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. This way, you donât need to\\nmanually set up all the cluster nodes and networking, which is usually too much for\\nsomeone making their first steps with Kubernetes.

The output shows the nodeâs sta-\\ntus, its CPU and memory data, system information, containers running on the node,\\nand much more.\\n In the previous kubectl describe example, you specified the name of the node\\nexplicitly, but you could also have performed a simple kubectl describe node without\\ntyping the nodeâs name and it would print out a detailed description of all the nodes.\\nTIP\\nRunning the describe and get commands without specifying the name\\nof the object comes in handy when only one object of a given type exists, so\\nyou donât waste time typing or copy/pasting the objectâs name.\\nWhile weâre talking about reducing keystrokes, let me give you additional advice on\\nhow to make working with kubectl much easier, before we move on to running your\\nfirst app in Kubernetes.\\n2.2.3\\nSetting up an alias and command-line completion for kubectl \\nYouâll use kubectl often.

If you havenât used aliases yet, hereâs how you define one. Add the follow-\\ning line to your ~/.bashrc or equivalent file:\\nalias k=kubectl\\nNOTE\\nYou may already have the k executable if you used gcloud to set up the\\ncluster.\\nCONFIGURING TAB COMPLETION FOR KUBECTL\\nEven with a short alias such as k, youâll still need to type way more than youâd like. Luck-\\nily, the kubectl command can also output shell completion code for both the bash and\\nzsh shell. It doesnât enable tab completion of only command names, but also of the\\nactual object names. For example, instead of having to write the whole node name in\\nthe previous example, all youâd need to type is\\n$ kubectl desc<TAB> no<TAB> gke-ku<TAB>\\n \\n',\n",

When you run the preceding command, tab completion will\\nonly work when you use the full kubectl name (it wonât work when you use the k\\nalias). To fix this, you need to transform the output of the kubectl completion com-\\nmand a bit:\\n$ source <(kubectl completion bash | sed s/kubectl/k/g)\\nNOTE\\nUnfortunately, as Iâm writing this, shell completion doesnât work for\\naliases on MacOS. Youâll have to use the full kubectl command name if you\\nwant completion to work.\\nNow youâre all set to start interacting with your cluster without having to type too\\nmuch. You can finally run your first app on Kubernetes.\\n2.3\\nRunning your first app on Kubernetes\\nBecause this may be your first time, youâll use the simplest possible way of running an\\napp on Kubernetes. Usually, youâd prepare a JSON or YAML manifest, containing a\\ndescription of all the components you want to deploy, but because we havenât talked\\nabout the types of components you can create in Kubernetes yet, youâll use a simple\\none-line command to get something running.\\n2.3.1\\nDeploying your Node.js app\\nThe simplest way to deploy your app is to use the kubectl run command, which will\\ncreate all the necessary components without having to deal with JSON or YAML. This\\nway, we donât need to dive into the structure of each object yet. Try to run the image\\nyou created and pushed to Docker Hub earlier. Hereâs how to run it in Kubernetes:\\n$ kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia --port=8080 --generator=run/v1\\nreplicationcontroller \"kubia\" created\\nThe --image=luksa/kubia part obviously specifies the container image you want to\\nrun, and the --port=8080 option tells Kubernetes that your app is listening on port\\n8080. The last flag (--generator) does require an explanation, though. Usually, you\\nwonât use it, but youâre using it here so Kubernetes creates a ReplicationController\\ninstead of a Deployment. Youâll learn what ReplicationControllers are later in the chap-\\nter, but we wonât talk about Deployments until chapter 9. Thatâs why I donât want\\nkubectl to create a Deployment yet.\\n As the previous commandâs output shows, a ReplicationController called kubia\\nhas been created. As already mentioned, weâll see what that is later in the chapter. For\\n \\n',\n",

Maybe something such as kubectl get containers? Well, thatâs not exactly\\nhow Kubernetes works. It doesnât deal with individual containers directly. Instead, it\\nuses the concept of multiple co-located containers. This group of containers is called\\na Pod. \\n A pod is a group of one or more tightly related containers that will always run\\ntogether on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace(s). Each pod\\nis like a separate logical machine with its own IP, hostname, processes, and so on,\\nrunning a single application. The application can be a single process, running in a\\nsingle container, or it can be a main application process and additional supporting\\nprocesses, each running in its own container. All the containers in a pod will appear\\nto be running on the same logical machine, whereas containers in other pods, even\\nif theyâre running on the same worker node, will appear to be running on a differ-\\nent one. \\n To better understand the relationship between containers, pods, and nodes, exam-\\nine figure 2.5. As you can see, each pod has its own IP and contains one or more con-\\ntainers, each running an application process. Pods are spread out across different\\nworker nodes.\\nLISTING PODS\\nBecause you canât list individual containers, since theyâre not standalone Kubernetes\\nobjects, can you list pods instead? Yes, you can. Letâs see how to tell kubectl to list\\npods in the following listing.\\nFigure 2.5\\nThe relationship between containers, pods, and physical worker nodes\\nWorker node 1\\nPod 2\\nIP: 10.1.0.2\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 3\\nIP: 10.1.0.3\\nContainer 1\\nPod 1\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nWorker node 2\\nPod 5\\nIP: 10.1.1.2\\nContainer 1\\nPod 6\\nIP: 10.1.1.3\\nContainer 1\\nPod 4\\nIP: 10.1.1.1\\nContainer\\nContainer 2\\nContainer 2\\n \\n',\n",

Its status is still Pending and the podâs single container is shown as\\nnot ready yet (this is what the 0/1 in the READY column means).

To\\nmake sure the image can be pulled successfully, try pulling the image manually with\\nthe docker pull command on another machine. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT HAPPENED BEHIND THE SCENES\\nTo help you visualize what transpired, look at figure 2.6. It shows both steps you had to\\nperform to get a container image running inside Kubernetes. First, you built the\\nimage and pushed it to Docker Hub. This was necessary because building the image\\non your local machine only makes it available on your local machine, but you needed\\nto make it accessible to the Docker daemons running on your worker nodes.\\n When you ran the kubectl command, it created a new ReplicationController\\nobject in the cluster by sending a REST HTTP request to the Kubernetes API server.\\nThe ReplicationController then created a new pod, which was then scheduled to one\\nof the worker nodes by the Scheduler. The Kubelet on that node saw that the pod was\\nscheduled to it and instructed Docker to pull the specified image from the registry\\nbecause the image wasnât available locally. After downloading the image, Docker cre-\\nated and ran the container. \\n The other two nodes are displayed to show context. They didnât play any role in\\nthe process, because the pod wasnât scheduled to them.\\nDEFINITION\\nThe term scheduling means assigning the pod to a node.

Even though the application is running in\\nthe worker nodeâs operating system, to the app it appears as though itâs running on\\na separate machine dedicated to the app itselfâno other processes are running\\nalongside it.\\n2.3.3\\nThe logical parts of your system\\nUntil now, Iâve mostly explained the actual physical components of your system. You\\nhave three worker nodes, which are VMs running Docker and the Kubelet, and you\\nhave a master node that controls the whole system. Honestly, we donât know if a single\\nmaster node is hosting all the individual components of the Kubernetes Control Plane\\nor if theyâre split across multiple nodes. It doesnât really matter, because youâre only\\ninteracting with the API server, which is accessible at a single endpoint.\\n Besides this physical view of the system, thereâs also a separate, logical view of it.\\nIâve already mentioned Pods, ReplicationControllers, and Services. All of them will be\\nexplained in the next few chapters, but letâs quickly look at how they fit together and\\nwhat roles they play in your little setup.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER, THE POD, AND THE SERVICE FIT TOGETHER\\nAs Iâve already explained, youâre not creating and working with containers directly.\\nInstead, the basic building block in Kubernetes is the pod. But, you didnât really cre-\\nate any pods either, at least not directly. By running the kubectl run command you\\ncreated a ReplicationController, and this ReplicationController is what created the\\nactual Pod object. To make that pod accessible from outside the cluster, you told\\nKubernetes to expose all the pods managed by that ReplicationController as a single\\nService. A rough picture of all three elements is presented in figure 2.7.\\nFigure 2.7\\nYour system consists of a ReplicationController, a Pod, and a Service.\\nPod: kubia-4jfyf\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nPort\\n8080\\nService: kubia-http\\nInternal IP: 10.3.246.185\\nExternal IP: 104.155.74.57\\nReplicationController: kubia\\nReplicas: 1\\nPort\\n8080\\nIncoming\\nrequest\\n \\n',\n",

It contains only a\\nsingle container, but generally a pod can contain as many containers as you want.\\nInside the container is your Node.js process, which is bound to port 8080 and is wait-\\ning for HTTP requests. The pod has its own unique private IP address and hostname. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nThe next component is the kubia ReplicationController. It makes sure thereâs always\\nexactly one instance of your pod running. Generally, ReplicationControllers are used\\nto replicate pods (that is, create multiple copies of a pod) and keep them running. In\\nyour case, you didnât specify how many pod replicas you want, so the Replication-\\nController created a single one. If your pod were to disappear for any reason, the\\nReplicationController would create a new pod to replace the missing one. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHY YOU NEED A SERVICE\\nThe third component of your system is the kubia-http service. To understand why\\nyou need services, you need to learn a key detail about pods. Theyâre ephemeral. A\\npod may disappear at any timeâbecause the node itâs running on has failed, because\\nsomeone deleted the pod, or because the pod was evicted from an otherwise healthy\\nnode. When any of those occurs, a missing pod is replaced with a new one by the\\nReplicationController, as described previously. This new pod gets a different IP\\naddress from the pod itâs replacing. This is where services come inâto solve the prob-\\nlem of ever-changing pod IP addresses, as well as exposing multiple pods at a single\\nconstant IP and port pair. \\n When a service is created, it gets a static IP, which never changes during the lifetime of\\nthe service. Instead of connecting to pods directly, clients should connect to the service\\nthrough its constant IP address. The service makes sure one of the pods receives the con-\\nnection, regardless of where the pod is currently running (and what its IP address is). \\n Services represent a static location for a group of one or more pods that all provide\\nthe same service. Requests coming to the IP and port of the service will be forwarded\\nto the IP and port of one of the pods belonging to the service at that moment.  \\n2.3.4\\nHorizontally scaling the application\\nYou now have a running application, monitored and kept running by a Replication-\\nController and exposed to the world through a service. Now letâs make additional\\nmagic happen. \\n One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can\\nscale your deployments. Letâs see how easy it is to scale up the number of pods. Youâll\\nincrease the number of running instances to three. \\n Your pod is managed by a ReplicationController. Letâs see it with the kubectl get\\ncommand:\\n$ kubectl get replicationcontrollers\\nNAME        DESIRED    CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia       1          1         17m\\n \\nwww.allitebooks.com\\n',\n",

Two are already running, one is still\\npending, but should be ready in a few moments, as soon as the container image is\\ndownloaded and the container is started. \\n As you can see, scaling an application is incredibly simple. Once your app is run-\\nning in production and a need to scale the app arises, you can add additional\\ninstances with a single command without having to install and run additional copies\\nmanually. \\n Keep in mind that the app itself needs to support being scaled horizontally. Kuber-\\nnetes doesnât magically make your app scalable; it only makes it trivial to scale the app\\nup or down. \\nSEEING REQUESTS HIT ALL THREE PODS WHEN HITTING THE SERVICE\\nBecause you now have multiple instances of your app running, letâs see what happens\\nif you hit the service URL again.

This is what services in Kubernetes do\\nwhen more than one pod instance backs them. They act as a load balancer standing in\\nfront of multiple pods. When thereâs only one pod, services provide a static address\\nfor the single pod. Whether a service is backed by a single pod or a group of pods,\\nthose pods come and go as theyâre moved around the cluster, which means their IP\\naddresses change, but the service is always there at the same address. This makes it\\neasy for clients to connect to the pods, regardless of how many exist and how often\\nthey change location.\\nVISUALIZING THE NEW STATE OF YOUR SYSTEM\\nLetâs visualize your system again to see whatâs changed from before. Figure 2.8\\nshows the new state of your system. You still have a single service and a single\\nReplicationController, but you now have three instances of your pod, all managed\\nby the ReplicationController. The service no longer sends all requests to a single\\npod, but spreads them across all three pods as shown in the experiment with curl\\nin the previous section.\\n As an exercise, you can now try spinning up additional instances by increasing the\\nReplicationControllerâs replica count even further and then scaling back down.\\n \\n',\n",

Instead of deploying containers individually,\\nyou always deploy and operate on a pod of containers. Weâre not implying that a pod\\nalways includes more than one containerâitâs common for pods to contain only a sin-\\ngle container. The key thing about pods is that when a pod does contain multiple con-\\ntainers, all of them are always run on a single worker nodeâit never spans multiple\\nworker nodes, as shown in figure 3.1.\\n3.1.1\\nUnderstanding why we need pods\\nBut why do we even need pods? Why canât we use containers directly? Why would we\\neven need to run multiple containers together? Canât we put all our processes into a\\nsingle container? Weâll answer those questions now.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHY MULTIPLE CONTAINERS ARE BETTER THAN ONE CONTAINER RUNNING \\nMULTIPLE PROCESSES\\nImagine an app consisting of multiple processes that either communicate through\\nIPC (Inter-Process Communication) or through locally stored files, which requires\\nthem to run on the same machine. Because in Kubernetes you always run processes in\\ncontainers and each container is much like an isolated machine, you may think it\\nmakes sense to run multiple processes in a single container, but you shouldnât do that. \\n Containers are designed to run only a single process per container (unless the\\nprocess itself spawns child processes). If you run multiple unrelated processes in a\\nsingle container, it is your responsibility to keep all those processes running, man-\\nage their logs, and so on. For example, youâd have to include a mechanism for auto-\\nmatically restarting individual processes if they crash. Also, all those processes would\\nlog to the same standard output, so youâd have a hard time figuring out what pro-\\ncess logged what. \\nNode 1\\nPod 2\\nIP: 10.1.0.2\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 1\\nIP: 10.1.0.1\\nContainer\\nNode 2\\nPod 4\\nIP: 10.1.1.2\\nContainer 1\\nPod 5\\nIP: 10.1.1.3\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod 3\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nFigure 3.1\\nAll containers of a pod run on the same node.

       "  'text': '57\\nIntroducing pods\\n Therefore, you need to run each process in its own container. Thatâs how Docker\\nand Kubernetes are meant to be used. \\n3.1.2\\nUnderstanding pods\\nBecause youâre not supposed to group multiple processes into a single container, itâs\\nobvious you need another higher-level construct that will allow you to bind containers\\ntogether and manage them as a single unit. This is the reasoning behind pods. \\n A pod of containers allows you to run closely related processes together and pro-\\nvide them with (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single\\ncontainer, while keeping them somewhat isolated. This way, you get the best of both\\nworlds. You can take advantage of all the features containers provide, while at the\\nsame time giving the processes the illusion of running together. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE PARTIAL ISOLATION BETWEEN CONTAINERS OF THE SAME POD\\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that containers are completely isolated from\\neach other, but now you see that you want to isolate groups of containers instead of\\nindividual ones. You want containers inside each group to share certain resources,\\nalthough not all, so that theyâre not fully isolated. Kubernetes achieves this by config-\\nuring Docker to have all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces\\ninstead of each container having its own set. \\n Because all containers of a pod run under the same Network and UTS namespaces\\n(weâre talking about Linux namespaces here), they all share the same hostname and\\nnetwork interfaces. Similarly, all containers of a pod run under the same IPC namespace\\nand can communicate through IPC. In the latest Kubernetes and Docker versions, they\\ncan also share the same PID namespace, but that feature isnât enabled by default. \\nNOTE\\nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, you\\nonly see the containerâs own processes when running ps aux in the container.\\nBut when it comes to the filesystem, things are a little different. Because most of the\\ncontainerâs filesystem comes from the container image, by default, the filesystem of\\neach container is fully isolated from other containers. However, itâs possible to have\\nthem share file directories using a Kubernetes concept called a Volume, which weâll\\ntalk about in chapter 6.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS SHARE THE SAME IP AND PORT SPACE\\nOne thing to stress here is that because containers in a pod run in the same Network\\nnamespace, they share the same IP address and port space. This means processes run-\\nning in containers of the same pod need to take care not to bind to the same port\\nnumbers or theyâll run into port conflicts. But this only concerns containers in the\\nsame pod. Containers of different pods can never run into port conflicts, because\\neach pod has a separate port space. All the containers in a pod also have the same\\nloopback network interface, so a container can communicate with other containers in\\nthe same pod through localhost.\\n \\n',\n",

No NAT (Network Address Translation) gateways exist between them.\\nWhen two pods send network packets between each other, theyâll each see the actual\\nIP address of the other as the source IP in the packet.\\nConsequently, communication between pods is always simple. It doesnât matter if two\\npods are scheduled onto a single or onto different worker nodes; in both cases the\\ncontainers inside those pods can communicate with each other across the flat NAT-\\nless network, much like computers on a local area network (LAN), regardless of the\\nactual inter-node network topology. Like a computer on a LAN, each pod gets its own\\nIP address and is accessible from all other pods through this network established spe-\\ncifically for pods. This is usually achieved through an additional software-defined net-\\nwork layered on top of the actual network.\\n To sum up whatâs been covered in this section: pods are logical hosts and behave\\nmuch like physical hosts or VMs in the non-container world. Processes running in the\\nsame pod are like processes running on the same physical or virtual machine, except\\nthat each process is encapsulated in a container. \\n3.1.3\\nOrganizing containers across pods properly\\nYou should think of pods as separate machines, but where each one hosts only a cer-\\ntain app. Unlike the old days, when we used to cram all sorts of apps onto the same\\nhost, we donât do that with pods. Because pods are relatively lightweight, you can have\\nas many as you need without incurring almost any overhead. Instead of stuffing every-\\nthing into a single pod, you should organize apps into multiple pods, where each one\\ncontains only tightly related components or processes.\\nNode 1\\nPod A\\nIP: 10.1.1.6\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod B\\nIP: 10.1.1.7\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nNode 2\\nFlat network\\nPod C\\nIP: 10.1.2.5\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nPod D\\nIP: 10.1.2.7\\nContainer 1\\nContainer 2\\nFigure 3.2\\nEach pod gets a routable IP address and all other pods see the pod under \\nthat IP address.\\n \\n',\n",

Weâve\\nsaid that all containers of the same pod always run co-located, but do the web server\\nand the database really need to run on the same machine? The answer is obviously no,\\nso you donât want to put them into a single pod. But is it wrong to do so regardless? In\\na way, it is.\\n If both the frontend and backend are in the same pod, then both will always be\\nrun on the same machine. If you have a two-node Kubernetes cluster and only this sin-\\ngle pod, youâll only be using a single worker node and not taking advantage of the\\ncomputational resources (CPU and memory) you have at your disposal on the second\\nnode. Splitting the pod into two would allow Kubernetes to schedule the frontend to\\none node and the backend to the other node, thereby improving the utilization of\\nyour infrastructure.\\nSPLITTING INTO MULTIPLE PODS TO ENABLE INDIVIDUAL SCALING\\nAnother reason why you shouldnât put them both into a single pod is scaling. A pod is\\nalso the basic unit of scaling. Kubernetes canât horizontally scale individual contain-\\ners; instead, it scales whole pods. If your pod consists of a frontend and a backend con-\\ntainer, when you scale up the number of instances of the pod to, letâs say, two, you end\\nup with two frontend containers and two backend containers. \\n Usually, frontend components have completely different scaling requirements\\nthan the backends, so we tend to scale them individually. Not to mention the fact that\\nbackends such as databases are usually much harder to scale compared to (stateless)\\nfrontend web servers. If you need to scale a container individually, this is a clear indi-\\ncation that it needs to be deployed in a separate pod. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHEN TO USE MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD\\nThe main reason to put multiple containers into a single pod is when the application\\nconsists of one main process and one or more complementary processes, as shown in\\nfigure 3.3.\\nPod\\nMain container\\nSupporting\\ncontainer 1\\nSupporting\\ncontainer 2\\nVolume\\nFigure 3.3\\nPods should contain tightly coupled \\ncontainers, usually a main container and containers \\nthat support the main one.\\n \\n',\n",

In chapter 6 youâll see that you need to use a Kubernetes Volume that you\\nmount into both containers. \\n Other examples of sidecar containers include log rotators and collectors, data pro-\\ncessors, communication adapters, and others.\\nDECIDING WHEN TO USE MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD\\nTo recap how containers should be grouped into podsâwhen deciding whether to\\nput two containers into a single pod or into two separate pods, you always need to ask\\nyourself the following questions:\\n\\uf0a1Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?\\n\\uf0a1Do they represent a single whole or are they independent components?\\n\\uf0a1Must they be scaled together or individually? \\nBasically, you should always gravitate toward running containers in separate pods,\\nunless a specific reason requires them to be part of the same pod. Figure 3.4 will help\\nyou memorize this.\\nAlthough pods can contain multiple containers, to keep things simple for now, youâll\\nonly be dealing with single-container pods in this chapter.

First, thereâs the Kubernetes API version\\nused in the YAML and the type of resource the YAML is describing. Then, three\\nimportant sections are found in almost all Kubernetes resources:\\n\\uf0a1Metadata includes the name, namespace, labels, and other information about\\nthe pod.\\n\\uf0a1Spec contains the actual description of the podâs contents, such as the podâs con-\\ntainers, volumes, and other data.\\nPod specification/\\ncontents (list of \\npodâs containers, \\nvolumes, and so on)\\nDetailed status \\nof the pod and \\nits containers\\n \\n',\n",

The status\\npart contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given\\nmoment.

The pod\\nconsists of a single container based on the luksa/kubia image.

This is to allow users to view logs of different applications in\\na simple, standard way. \\n The container runtime (Docker in your case) redirects those streams to files and\\nallows you to get the containerâs log by running\\n$ docker logs <container id>\\nYou could use ssh to log into the node where your pod is running and retrieve its logs\\nwith docker logs, but Kubernetes provides an easier way. \\nRETRIEVING A PODâS LOG WITH KUBECTL LOGS\\nTo see your podâs log (more precisely, the containerâs log) you run the following com-\\nmand on your local machine (no need to ssh anywhere):\\n$ kubectl logs kubia-manual\\nKubia server starting...\\nYou havenât sent any web requests to your Node.js app, so the log only shows a single\\nlog statement about the server starting up. As you can see, retrieving logs of an appli-\\ncation running in Kubernetes is incredibly simple if the pod only contains a single\\ncontainer. \\nNOTE\\nContainer logs are automatically rotated daily and every time the log file\\nreaches 10MB in size. The kubectl logs command only shows the log entries\\nfrom the last rotation.\\nSPECIFYING THE CONTAINER NAME WHEN GETTING LOGS OF A MULTI-CONTAINER POD\\nIf your pod includes multiple containers, you have to explicitly specify the container\\nname by including the -c <container name> option when running kubectl logs. In\\nyour kubia-manual pod, you set the containerâs name to kubia, so if additional con-\\ntainers exist in the pod, youâd have to get its logs like this:\\n$ kubectl logs kubia-manual -c kubia\\nKubia server starting...\\nNote that you can only retrieve container logs of pods that are still in existence. When\\na pod is deleted, its logs are also deleted. To make a podâs logs available even after the\\npod is deleted, you need to set up centralized, cluster-wide logging, which stores all\\nthe logs into a central store. Chapter 17 explains how centralized logging works.\\n3.2.5\\nSending requests to the pod\\nThe pod is now runningâat least thatâs what kubectl get and your appâs log say. But\\nhow do you see it in action? In the previous chapter, you used the kubectl expose\\ncommand to create a service to gain access to the pod externally. Youâre not going to\\ndo that now, because a whole chapter is dedicated to services, and you have other ways\\nof connecting to a pod for testing and debugging purposes. One of them is through\\nport forwarding.\\n \\n',\n",

This is done through the kubectl port-forward command. The following\\ncommand will forward your machineâs local port 8888 to port 8080 of your kubia-\\nmanual pod:\\n$ kubectl port-forward kubia-manual 8888:8080\\n...

Youâll\\nlearn about other similar methods throughout the book. \\n3.3\\nOrganizing pods with labels\\nAt this point, you have two pods running in your cluster. When deploying actual\\napplications, most users will end up running many more pods.

As Iâve mentioned in the previous chapter, this is the proper way\\nof working in a Kubernetes cluster. Because Kubernetes exposes all the nodes in the\\ncluster as a single, large deployment platform, it shouldnât matter to you what node a\\npod is scheduled to. Because each pod gets the exact amount of computational\\nresources it requests (CPU, memory, and so on) and its accessibility from other pods\\nisnât at all affected by the node the pod is scheduled to, usually there shouldnât be any\\nneed for you to tell Kubernetes exactly where to schedule your pods. \\n Certain cases exist, however, where youâll want to have at least a little say in where\\na pod should be scheduled. A good example is when your hardware infrastructure\\nisnât homogenous. If part of your worker nodes have spinning hard drives, whereas\\nothers have SSDs, you may want to schedule certain pods to one group of nodes and\\nthe rest to the other. Another example is when you need to schedule pods perform-\\ning intensive GPU-based computation only to nodes that provide the required GPU\\nacceleration. \\n You never want to say specifically what node a pod should be scheduled to, because\\nthat would couple the application to the infrastructure, whereas the whole idea of\\nKubernetes is hiding the actual infrastructure from the apps that run on it. But if you\\nwant to have a say in where a pod should be scheduled, instead of specifying an exact\\nnode, you should describe the node requirements and then let Kubernetes select a\\nnode that matches those requirements. This can be done through node labels and\\nnode label selectors. \\nUI pod\\napp: ui\\nrel: stable\\nrel=stable\\napp=ui\\nAccount\\nService\\npod\\napp: as\\nrel: stable\\napp=as\\napp: pc\\nrel: stable\\napp=pc\\napp: sc\\nrel: stable\\napp=sc\\napp: os\\nrel: stable\\napp=os\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nShopping\\nCart\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nUI pod\\napp: ui\\nrel: beta\\nrel=beta\\napp: pc\\nrel: beta\\napp: os\\nrel: beta\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nrel=canary\\nAccount\\nService\\npod\\napp: as\\nrel: canary\\napp: pc\\nrel: canary\\napp: os\\nrel: canary\\nProduct\\nCatalog\\npod\\nOrder\\nService\\npod\\nFigure 3.9\\nSelecting pods with multiple label selectors\\n \\n',\n",

You want to add a label to the node showing this\\nfeature. Youâre going to add the label gpu=true to one of your nodes (pick one out of\\nthe list returned by kubectl get nodes):\\n$ kubectl label node gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx gpu=true\\nnode \"gke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx\" labeled\\nNow you can use a label selector when listing the nodes, like you did before with pods.\\nList only nodes that include the label gpu=true:\\n$ kubectl get nodes -l gpu=true\\nNAME                      STATUS AGE\\ngke-kubia-85f6-node-0rrx  Ready  1d\\nAs expected, only one node has this label. You can also try listing all the nodes and tell\\nkubectl to display an additional column showing the values of each nodeâs gpu label\\n(kubectl get nodes -L gpu).\\n3.5.2\\nScheduling pods to specific nodes\\nNow imagine you want to deploy a new pod that needs a GPU to perform its work.\\nTo ask the scheduler to only choose among the nodes that provide a GPU, youâll\\nadd a node selector to the podâs YAML. Create a file called kubia-gpu.yaml with the\\nfollowing listingâs contents and then use kubectl create -f kubia-gpu.yaml to cre-\\nate the pod.\\napiVersion: v1                                         \\nkind: Pod                                              \\nmetadata:                                              \\n  name: kubia-gpu\\nspec: \\n  nodeSelector:               \\n    gpu: \"true\"               \\n  containers: \\n  - image: luksa/kubia\\n    name: kubia\\nListing 3.4\\nUsing a label selector to schedule a pod to a specific node: kubia-gpu.yaml\\nnodeSelector tells Kubernetes \\nto deploy this pod only to \\nnodes containing the \\ngpu=true label.\\n \\n',\n",

When you create the pod,\\nthe scheduler will only choose among the nodes that contain the gpu=true label\\n(which is only a single node in your case). \\n3.5.3\\nScheduling to one specific node\\nSimilarly, you could also schedule a pod to an exact node, because each node also has\\na unique label with the key kubernetes.io/hostname and value set to the actual host-\\nname of the node. But setting the nodeSelector to a specific node by the hostname\\nlabel may lead to the pod being unschedulable if the node is offline. You shouldnât\\nthink in terms of individual nodes. Always think about logical groups of nodes that sat-\\nisfy certain criteria specified through label selectors.\\n This was a quick demonstration of how labels and label selectors work and how\\nthey can be used to influence the operation of Kubernetes. The importance and use-\\nfulness of label selectors will become even more evident when we talk about Replication-\\nControllers and Services in the next two chapters. \\nNOTE\\nAdditional ways of influencing which node a pod is scheduled to are\\ncovered in chapter 16.\\n3.6\\nAnnotating pods\\nIn addition to labels, pods and other objects can also contain annotations. Annotations\\nare also key-value pairs, so in essence, theyâre similar to labels, but they arenât meant to\\nhold identifying information. They canât be used to group objects the way labels can.\\nWhile objects can be selected through label selectors, thereâs no such thing as an\\nannotation selector. \\n On the other hand, annotations can hold much larger pieces of information and\\nare primarily meant to be used by tools. Certain annotations are automatically added\\nto objects by Kubernetes, but others are added by users manually.\\n Annotations are also commonly used when introducing new features to Kuberne-\\ntes. Usually, alpha and beta versions of new features donât introduce any new fields to\\nAPI objects. Annotations are used instead of fields, and then once the required API\\nchanges have become clear and been agreed upon by the Kubernetes developers, new\\nfields are introduced and the related annotations deprecated.\\n A great use of annotations is adding descriptions for each pod or other API object,\\nso that everyone using the cluster can quickly look up information about each individ-\\nual object. For example, an annotation used to specify the name of the person who\\ncreated the object can make collaboration between everyone working on the cluster\\nmuch easier.\\n3.6.1\\nLooking up an objectâs annotations\\nLetâs see an example of an annotation that Kubernetes added automatically to the\\npod you created in the previous chapter.

You may want to only operate inside one group at a time. For this and other\\nreasons, Kubernetes also groups objects into namespaces. These arenât the Linux\\nnamespaces we talked about in chapter 2, which are used to isolate processes from\\neach other. Kubernetes namespaces provide a scope for objects names. Instead of hav-\\ning all your resources in one single namespace, you can split them into multiple name-\\nspaces, which also allows you to use the same resource names multiple times (across\\ndifferent namespaces).\\n3.7.1\\nUnderstanding the need for namespaces\\nUsing multiple namespaces allows you to split complex systems with numerous com-\\nponents into smaller distinct groups. They can also be used for separating resources\\nin a multi-tenant environment, splitting up resources into production, development,\\nand QA environments, or in any other way you may need. Resource names only need\\nto be unique within a namespace. Two different namespaces can contain resources of\\nthe same name. But, while most types of resources are namespaced, a few arenât. One\\nof them is the Node resource, which is global and not tied to a single namespace.\\nYouâll learn about other cluster-level resources in later chapters.\\n Letâs see how to use namespaces now.\\n3.7.2\\nDiscovering other namespaces and their pods\\nFirst, letâs list all namespaces in your cluster:\\n$ kubectl get ns\\nNAME          LABELS    STATUS    AGE\\ndefault       <none>    Active    1h\\nkube-public   <none>    Active    1h\\nkube-system   <none>    Active    1h\\nUp to this point, youâve operated only in the default namespace. When listing resources\\nwith the kubectl get command, youâve never specified the namespace explicitly, so\\nkubectl always defaulted to the default namespace, showing you only the objects in\\nthat namespace. But as you can see from the list, the kube-public and the kube-system\\nnamespaces also exist. Letâs look at the pods that belong to the kube-system name-\\nspace, by telling kubectl to list pods in that namespace only:\\n$ kubectl get po --namespace kube-system\\nNAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nfluentd-cloud-kubia-e8fe-node-txje   1/1       Running   0          1h\\nheapster-v11-fz1ge                   1/1       Running   0          1h\\nkube-dns-v9-p8a4t                    0/4       Pending   0          1h\\nkube-ui-v4-kdlai                     1/1       Running   0          1h\\nl7-lb-controller-v0.5.2-bue96        2/2       Running   92         1h\\nTIP\\nYou can also use -n instead of --namespace.\\n \\n',\n",

To learn more about managing\\nkubectl contexts, refer to appendix A. \\nTIP\\nTo quickly switch to a different namespace, you can set up the following\\nalias: alias kcd=\\'kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-\\ncontext) --namespace \\'.

Although namespaces allow you to isolate objects\\ninto distinct groups, which allows you to operate only on those belonging to the speci-\\nfied namespace, they donât provide any kind of isolation of running objects. \\n For example, you may think that when different users deploy pods across different\\nnamespaces, those pods are isolated from each other and canât communicate, but thatâs\\nnot necessarily the case. Whether namespaces provide network isolation depends on\\nwhich networking solution is deployed with Kubernetes.

In\\nchapter 2, I mentioned that this doesnât create a pod directly, but instead creates a\\nReplicationController, which then creates the pod. As soon as you delete a pod cre-\\nated by the ReplicationController, it immediately creates a new one. To delete the\\npod, you also need to delete the ReplicationController. \\n3.8.5\\nDeleting (almost) all resources in a namespace\\nYou can delete the ReplicationController and the pods, as well as all the Services\\nyouâve created, by deleting all resources in the current namespace with a single\\ncommand:\\n$ kubectl delete all --all\\npod \"kubia-09as0\" deleted\\nreplicationcontroller \"kubia\" deleted\\nservice \"kubernetes\" deleted\\nservice \"kubia-http\" deleted\\nThe first all in the command specifies that youâre deleting resources of all types, and\\nthe --all option specifies that youâre deleting all resource instances instead of speci-\\nfying them by name (you already used this option when you ran the previous delete\\ncommand).\\nNOTE\\nDeleting everything with the all keyword doesnât delete absolutely\\neverything. Certain resources (like Secrets, which weâll introduce in chapter 7)\\nare preserved and need to be deleted explicitly.\\nAs it deletes resources, kubectl will print the name of every resource it deletes. In the\\nlist, you should see the kubia ReplicationController and the kubia-http Service you\\ncreated in chapter 2. \\nNOTE\\nThe kubectl delete all --all command also deletes the kubernetes\\nService, but it should be recreated automatically in a few moments.\\n3.9\\nSummary\\nAfter reading this chapter, you should now have a decent knowledge of the central\\nbuilding block in Kubernetes. Every other concept youâll learn about in the next few\\nchapters is directly related to pods. \\n In this chapter, youâve learned\\n\\uf0a1How to decide whether certain containers should be grouped together in a pod\\nor not.\\n \\n',\n",

But if the whole node\\nfails, the pods on the node are lost and will not be replaced with new ones, unless\\nthose pods are managed by the previously mentioned ReplicationControllers or simi-\\nlar. In this chapter, youâll learn how Kubernetes checks if a container is still alive and\\nrestarts it if it isnât. Youâll also learn how to run managed podsâboth those that run\\nindefinitely and those that perform a single task and then stop. \\n4.1\\nKeeping pods healthy\\nOne of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the ability to give it a list of contain-\\ners and let it keep those containers running somewhere in the cluster. You do this by\\ncreating a Pod resource and letting Kubernetes pick a worker node for it and run\\nthe podâs containers on that node. But what if one of those containers dies? What if\\nall containers of a pod die? \\n As soon as a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node will run its con-\\ntainers and, from then on, keep them running as long as the pod exists. If the con-\\ntainerâs main process crashes, the Kubelet will restart the container. If your\\napplication has a bug that causes it to crash every once in a while, Kubernetes will\\nrestart it automatically, so even without doing anything special in the app itself, run-\\nning the app in Kubernetes automatically gives it the ability to heal itself. \\n But sometimes apps stop working without their process crashing. For example, a\\nJava app with a memory leak will start throwing OutOfMemoryErrors, but the JVM\\nprocess will keep running. It would be great to have a way for an app to signal to\\nKubernetes that itâs no longer functioning properly and have Kubernetes restart it. \\n Weâve said that a container that crashes is restarted automatically, so maybe youâre\\nthinking you could catch these types of errors in the app and exit the process when\\nthey occur. You can certainly do that, but it still doesnât solve all your problems. \\n For example, what about those situations when your app stops responding because\\nit falls into an infinite loop or a deadlock? To make sure applications are restarted in\\nsuch cases, you must check an applicationâs health from the outside and not depend\\non the app doing it internally. \\n4.1.1\\nIntroducing liveness probes\\nKubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes. You can specify\\na liveness probe for each container in the podâs specification. Kubernetes will periodi-\\ncally execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails. \\nNOTE\\nKubernetes also supports readiness probes, which weâll learn about in the\\nnext chapter. Be sure not to confuse the two. Theyâre used for two different\\nthings.\\nKubernetes can probe a container using one of the three mechanisms:\\n\\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe performs an HTTP GET request on the containerâs IP\\naddress, a port and path you specify.

The delay=0s part shows that\\nthe probing begins immediately after the container is started. The timeout is set to\\nonly 1 second, so the container must return a response in 1 second or the probe is\\ncounted as failed. The container is probed every 10 seconds (period=10s) and the\\ncontainer is restarted after the probe fails three consecutive times (#failure=3). \\n These additional parameters can be customized when defining the probe.

If the number of failures exceeds the failure threshold, the con-\\ntainer is restarted before itâs even able to start responding to requests properly. \\nTIP\\nAlways remember to set an initial delay to account for your appâs startup\\ntime.\\nIâve seen this on many occasions and users were confused why their container was\\nbeing restarted. But if theyâd used kubectl describe, theyâd have seen that the con-\\ntainer terminated with exit code 137 or 143, telling them that the pod was terminated\\nexternally. Additionally, the listing of the podâs events would show that the container\\nwas killed because of a failed liveness probe. If you see this happening at pod startup,\\nitâs because you failed to set initialDelaySeconds appropriately.\\nNOTE\\nExit code 137 signals that the process was killed by an external signal\\n(exit code is 128 + 9 (SIGKILL). Likewise, exit code 143 corresponds to 128 +\\n15 (SIGTERM).\\n4.1.5\\nCreating effective liveness probes\\nFor pods running in production, you should always define a liveness probe. Without\\none, Kubernetes has no way of knowing whether your app is still alive or not. As long\\nas the process is still running, Kubernetes will consider the container to be healthy. \\nWHAT A LIVENESS PROBE SHOULD CHECK\\nYour simplistic liveness probe simply checks if the server is responding. While this may\\nseem overly simple, even a liveness probe like this does wonders, because it causes the\\ncontainer to be restarted if the web server running within the container stops\\nresponding to HTTP requests. Compared to having no liveness probe, this is a major\\nimprovement, and may be sufficient in most cases.\\n But for a better liveness check, youâd configure the probe to perform requests on a\\nspecific URL path (/health, for example) and have the app perform an internal sta-\\ntus check of all the vital components running inside the app to ensure none of them\\nhas died or is unresponsive. \\nTIP\\nMake sure the /health HTTP endpoint doesnât require authentication;\\notherwise the probe will always fail, causing your container to be restarted\\nindefinitely.\\nBe sure to check only the internals of the app and nothing influenced by an external\\nfactor. For example, a frontend web serverâs liveness probe shouldnât return a failure\\nwhen the server canât connect to the backend database. If the underlying cause is in\\nthe database itself, restarting the web server container will not fix the problem.\\nKubernetes will wait 15 seconds \\nbefore executing the first probe.\\n \\n',\n",

By default, the probes are executed relatively often and are\\nonly allowed one second to complete. Having a probe that does heavy lifting can slow\\ndown your container considerably. Later in the book, youâll also learn about how to\\nlimit CPU time available to a container. The probeâs CPU time is counted in the con-\\ntainerâs CPU time quota, so having a heavyweight liveness probe will reduce the CPU\\ntime available to the main application processes.\\nTIP\\nIf youâre running a Java app in your container, be sure to use an HTTP\\nGET liveness probe instead of an Exec probe, where you spin up a whole new\\nJVM to get the liveness information. The same goes for any JVM-based or sim-\\nilar applications, whose start-up procedure requires considerable computa-\\ntional resources.\\nDONâT BOTHER IMPLEMENTING RETRY LOOPS IN YOUR PROBES\\nYouâve already seen that the failure threshold for the probe is configurable and usu-\\nally the probe must fail multiple times before the container is killed. But even if you\\nset the failure threshold to 1, Kubernetes will retry the probe several times before con-\\nsidering it a single failed attempt. Therefore, implementing your own retry loop into\\nthe probe is wasted effort.\\nLIVENESS PROBE WRAP-UP\\nYou now understand that Kubernetes keeps your containers running by restarting\\nthem if they crash or if their liveness probes fail. This job is performed by the Kubelet\\non the node hosting the podâthe Kubernetes Control Plane components running on\\nthe master(s) have no part in this process. \\n But if the node itself crashes, itâs the Control Plane that must create replacements for\\nall the pods that went down with the node. It doesnât do that for pods that you create\\ndirectly. Those pods arenât managed by anything except by the Kubelet, but because the\\nKubelet runs on the node itself, it canât do anything if the node fails. \\n To make sure your app is restarted on another node, you need to have the pod\\nmanaged by a ReplicationController or similar mechanism, which weâll discuss in the\\nrest of this chapter. \\n4.2\\nIntroducing ReplicationControllers\\nA ReplicationController is a Kubernetes resource that ensures its pods are always\\nkept running. If the pod disappears for any reason, such as in the event of a node\\ndisappearing from the cluster or because the pod was evicted from the node, the\\nReplicationController notices the missing pod and creates a replacement pod. \\n Figure 4.1 shows what happens when a node goes down and takes two pods with it.\\nPod A was created directly and is therefore an unmanaged pod, while pod B is managed\\n \\n',\n",

The template\\ntherefore only affects new pods created by this ReplicationController. You can think\\nof it as a cookie cutter for cutting out new pods.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE BENEFITS OF USING A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nLike many things in Kubernetes, a ReplicationController, although an incredibly sim-\\nple concept, provides or enables the following powerful features:\\n\\uf0a1It makes sure a pod (or multiple pod replicas) is always running by starting a\\nnew pod when an existing one goes missing.\\n\\uf0a1When a cluster node fails, it creates replacement replicas for all the pods that\\nwere running on the failed node (those that were under the Replication-\\nControllerâs control).\\n\\uf0a1It enables easy horizontal scaling of podsâboth manual and automatic (see\\nhorizontal pod auto-scaling in chapter 15).\\nNOTE\\nA pod instance is never relocated to another node. Instead, the\\nReplicationController creates a completely new pod instance that has no rela-\\ntion to the instance itâs replacing. \\n4.2.2\\nCreating a ReplicationController\\nLetâs look at how to create a ReplicationController and then see how it keeps your\\npods running. Like pods and other Kubernetes resources, you create a Replication-\\nController by posting a JSON or YAML descriptor to the Kubernetes API server.\\n Youâre going to create a YAML file called kubia-rc.yaml for your Replication-\\nController, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ReplicationController     \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia                      \\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3                     \\n  selector:              \\n    app: kubia           \\nListing 4.4\\nA YAML definition of a ReplicationController: kubia-rc.yaml\\nThis manifest defines a \\nReplicationController (RC)\\nThe name of this \\nReplicationController\\nThe desired number \\nof pod instances\\nThe pod selector determining \\nwhat pods the RC is operating on\\n \\n',\n",

The contents of the template are almost identical to\\nthe pod definition you created in the previous chapter. \\n The pod labels in the template must obviously match the label selector of the\\nReplicationController; otherwise the controller would create new pods indefinitely,\\nbecause spinning up a new pod wouldnât bring the actual replica count any closer to\\nthe desired number of replicas. To prevent such scenarios, the API server verifies the\\nReplicationController definition and will not accept it if itâs misconfigured.\\n Not specifying the selector at all is also an option. In that case, it will be configured\\nautomatically from the labels in the pod template. \\nTIP\\nDonât specify a pod selector when defining a ReplicationController.

       "  'text': \"97\\nIntroducing ReplicationControllers\\nRESPONDING TO A NODE FAILURE\\nSeeing the ReplicationController respond to the manual deletion of a pod isnât too\\ninteresting, so letâs look at a better example. If youâre using Google Kubernetes Engine\\nto run these examples, you have a three-node Kubernetes cluster. Youâre going to dis-\\nconnect one of the nodes from the network to simulate a node failure.\\nNOTE\\nIf youâre using Minikube, you canât do this exercise, because you only\\nhave one node that acts both as a master and a worker node.\\nIf a node fails in the non-Kubernetes world, the ops team would need to migrate the\\napplications running on that node to other machines manually. Kubernetes, on the\\nother hand, does that automatically. Soon after the ReplicationController detects that\\nits pods are down, it will spin up new pods to replace them. \\n Letâs see this in action. You need to ssh into one of the nodes with the gcloud\\ncompute ssh command and then shut down its network interface with sudo ifconfig\\neth0 down, as shown in the following listing.\\nNOTE\\nChoose a node that runs at least one of your pods by listing pods with\\nthe -o wide option.\\n$ gcloud compute ssh gke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko\\nEnter passphrase for key '/home/luksa/.ssh/google_compute_engine':\\nWelcome to Kubernetes v1.6.4!\\n...\\nluksa@gke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko ~ $ sudo ifconfig eth0 down\\nWhen you shut down the network interface, the ssh session will stop responding, so\\nyou need to open up another terminal or hard-exit from the ssh session. In the new\\nterminal you can list the nodes to see if Kubernetes has detected that the node is\\ndown. This takes a minute or so. Then, the nodeâs status is shown as NotReady:\\n$ kubectl get node\\nNAME                                   STATUS     AGE\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-opc5   Ready      5h\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-s8gj   Ready      5h\\ngke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko   NotReady   5h    \\nIf you list the pods now, youâll still see the same three pods as before, because Kuber-\\nnetes waits a while before rescheduling pods (in case the node is unreachable because\\nof a temporary network glitch or because the Kubelet is restarting). If the node stays\\nunreachable for several minutes, the status of the pods that were scheduled to that\\nnode changes to Unknown. At that point, the ReplicationController will immediately\\nspin up a new pod. You can see this by listing the pods again:\\nListing 4.6\\nSimulating a node failure by shutting down its network interface\\nNode isnât ready, \\nbecause itâs \\ndisconnected from \\nthe network\\n \\n\",\n",

You again\\nhave three pod instances running, which means the ReplicationController has again\\ndone its job of bringing the actual state of the system to the desired state. \\n The same thing happens if a node fails (either breaks down or becomes unreach-\\nable). No immediate human intervention is necessary. The system heals itself\\nautomatically. \\n To bring the node back, you need to reset it with the following command:\\n$ gcloud compute instances reset gke-kubia-default-pool-b46381f1-zwko\\nWhen the node boots up again, its status should return to Ready, and the pod whose\\nstatus was Unknown will be deleted.\\n4.2.4\\nMoving pods in and out of the scope of a ReplicationController\\nPods created by a ReplicationController arenât tied to the ReplicationController in\\nany way. At any moment, a ReplicationController manages pods that match its label\\nselector. By changing a podâs labels, it can be removed from or added to the scope\\nof a ReplicationController. It can even be moved from one ReplicationController to\\nanother.\\nTIP\\nAlthough a pod isnât tied to a ReplicationController, the pod does refer-\\nence it in the metadata.ownerReferences field, which you can use to easily\\nfind which ReplicationController a pod belongs to.\\nIf you change a podâs labels so they no longer match a ReplicationControllerâs label\\nselector, the pod becomes like any other manually created pod. Itâs no longer man-\\naged by anything. If the node running the pod fails, the pod is obviously not resched-\\nuled. But keep in mind that when you changed the podâs labels, the replication\\ncontroller noticed one pod was missing and spun up a new pod to replace it.\\n Letâs try this with your pods. Because your ReplicationController manages pods\\nthat have the app=kubia label, you need to either remove this label or change its value\\nto move the pod out of the ReplicationControllerâs scope. Adding another label will\\nhave no effect, because the ReplicationController doesnât care if the pod has any addi-\\ntional labels. It only cares whether the pod has all the labels referenced in the label\\nselector. \\nThis podâs status is \\nunknown, because its \\nnode is unreachable.\\nThis pod was created \\nfive seconds ago.\\n \\n',\n",

Listing all pods again shows\\nthe same three pods as before, because no change occurred as far as the Replication-\\nController is concerned.\\nCHANGING THE LABELS OF A MANAGED POD\\nNow, youâll change the app=kubia label to something else. This will make the pod no\\nlonger match the ReplicationControllerâs label selector, leaving it to only match two\\npods. The ReplicationController should therefore start a new pod to bring the num-\\nber back to three:\\n$ kubectl label pod kubia-dmdck app=foo --overwrite\\npod \"kubia-dmdck\" labeled\\nThe --overwrite argument is necessary; otherwise kubectl will only print out a warn-\\ning and wonât change the label, to prevent you from inadvertently changing an exist-\\ning labelâs value when your intent is to add a new one. \\n Listing all the pods again should now show four pods: \\n$ kubectl get pods -L app\\nNAME         READY  STATUS             RESTARTS  AGE  APP\\nkubia-2qneh  0/1    ContainerCreating  0         2s   kubia   \\nkubia-oini2  1/1    Running            0         20m  kubia\\nkubia-k0xz6  1/1    Running            0         20m  kubia\\nkubia-dmdck  1/1    Running            0         10m  foo    \\nNOTE\\nYouâre using the -L app option to display the app label in a column.\\nThere, you now have four pods altogether: one that isnât managed by your Replication-\\nController and three that are. Among them is the newly created pod.\\n Figure 4.5 illustrates what happened when you changed the podâs labels so they no\\nlonger matched the ReplicationControllerâs pod selector. You can see your three pods\\nand your ReplicationController. After you change the podâs label from app=kubia to\\napp=foo, the ReplicationController no longer cares about the pod. Because the con-\\ntrollerâs replica count is set to 3 and only two pods match the label selector, the\\nNewly created pod that replaces\\nthe pod you removed from the\\nscope of the ReplicationController\\nPod no longer \\nmanaged by the \\nReplicationController\\n \\n',\n",

Changing the pod\\ntemplate is like replacing a cookie cutter with another one. It will only affect the cookies\\nyou cut out afterward and will have no effect on the ones youâve already cut (see figure\\n4.6). To modify the old pods, youâd need to delete them and let the Replication-\\nController replace them with new ones based on the new template.\\nAs an exercise, you can try editing the ReplicationController and adding a label to the\\npod template. You can edit the ReplicationController with the following command:\\n$ kubectl edit rc kubia\\nThis will open the ReplicationControllerâs YAML definition in your default text editor.\\nFind the pod template section and add an additional label to the metadata. After you\\nsave your changes and exit the editor, kubectl will update the ReplicationController\\nand print the following message:\\nreplicationcontroller \"kubia\" edited\\nYou can now list pods and their labels again and confirm that they havenât changed.\\nBut if you delete the pods and wait for their replacements to be created, youâll see the\\nnew label.\\n Editing a ReplicationController like this to change the container image in the pod\\ntemplate, deleting the existing pods, and letting them be replaced with new ones from\\nthe new template could be used for upgrading pods, but youâll learn a better way of\\ndoing that in chapter 9. \\nReplication\\nController\\nReplicas: 3\\nTemplate:\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nReplication\\nController\\nReplicas: 3\\nTemplate:\\nA\\nReplication\\nController\\nReplicas: 3\\nTemplate:\\nA\\nReplication\\nController\\nReplicas: 3\\nTemplate:\\nD\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nA\\nB\\nC\\nA\\nB\\nChange\\ntemplate\\nDelete\\na pod\\nRC creates\\nnew pod\\nFigure 4.6\\nChanging a ReplicationControllerâs pod template only affects pods created afterward and has no \\neffect on existing pods.\\n \\n',\n",

Because itâs incredibly simple to change the desired number of rep-\\nlicas, this also means scaling pods horizontally is trivial. \\n Scaling the number of pods up or down is as easy as changing the value of the rep-\\nlicas field in the ReplicationController resource. After the change, the Replication-\\nController will either see too many pods exist (when scaling down) and delete part of\\nthem, or see too few of them (when scaling up) and create additional pods. \\nSCALING UP A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\\nYour ReplicationController has been keeping three instances of your pod running.\\nYouâre going to scale that number up to 10 now. As you may remember, youâve\\nalready scaled a ReplicationController in chapter 2. You could use the same com-\\nmand as before:\\n$ kubectl scale rc kubia --replicas=10\\nBut youâll do it differently this time. \\nSCALING A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER BY EDITING ITS DEFINITION\\nInstead of using the kubectl scale command, youâre going to scale it in a declarative\\nway by editing the ReplicationControllerâs definition:\\n$ kubectl edit rc kubia\\nWhen the text editor opens, find the spec.replicas field and change its value to 10,\\nas shown in the following listing.\\n# Please edit the object below.

If an error occurs while saving \\n# this file will be reopened with the relevant failures.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ReplicationController\\nConfiguring kubectl edit to use a different text editor\\nYou can tell kubectl to use a text editor of your choice by setting the KUBE_EDITOR\\nenvironment variable. For example, if youâd like to use nano for editing Kubernetes\\nresources, execute the following command (or put it into your ~/.bashrc or an\\nequivalent file):\\nexport KUBE_EDITOR=\"/usr/bin/nano\"\\nIf the KUBE_EDITOR environment variable isnât set, kubectl edit falls back to using\\nthe default editor, usually configured through the EDITOR environment variable.\\nListing 4.7\\nEditing the RC in a text editor by running kubectl edit\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '105\\nUsing ReplicaSets instead of ReplicationControllers\\n You usually wonât create them directly, but instead have them created automati-\\ncally when you create the higher-level Deployment resource, which youâll learn about\\nin chapter 9. In any case, you should understand ReplicaSets, so letâs see how they dif-\\nfer from ReplicationControllers.\\n4.3.1\\nComparing a ReplicaSet to a ReplicationController\\nA ReplicaSet behaves exactly like a ReplicationController, but it has more expressive\\npod selectors. Whereas a ReplicationControllerâs label selector only allows matching\\npods that include a certain label, a ReplicaSetâs selector also allows matching pods\\nthat lack a certain label or pods that include a certain label key, regardless of\\nits value.\\n Also, for example, a single ReplicationController canât match pods with the label\\nenv=production and those with the label env=devel at the same time. It can only match\\neither pods with the env=production label or pods with the env=devel label. But a sin-\\ngle ReplicaSet can match both sets of pods and treat them as a single group. \\n Similarly, a ReplicationController canât match pods based merely on the presence\\nof a label key, regardless of its value, whereas a ReplicaSet can. For example, a Replica-\\nSet can match all pods that include a label with the key env, whatever its actual value is\\n(you can think of it as env=*).\\n4.3.2\\nDefining a ReplicaSet\\nYouâre going to create a ReplicaSet now to see how the orphaned pods that were cre-\\nated by your ReplicationController and then abandoned earlier can now be adopted\\nby a ReplicaSet. First, youâll rewrite your ReplicationController into a ReplicaSet by\\ncreating a new file called kubia-replicaset.yaml with the contents in the following\\nlisting.\\napiVersion: apps/v1beta2      \\nkind: ReplicaSet                    \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3\\n  selector:\\n    matchLabels:                 \\n      app: kubia                 \\n  template:                        \\n    metadata:                      \\n      labels:                      \\n        app: kubia                 \\n    spec:                          \\n      containers:                  \\n      - name: kubia                \\n        image: luksa/kubia         \\nListing 4.8\\nA YAML definition of a ReplicaSet: kubia-replicaset.yaml\\nReplicaSets arenât part of the v1 \\nAPI, but belong to the apps API \\ngroup and version v1beta2.\\nYouâre using the simpler matchLabels \\nselector here, which is much like a \\nReplicationControllerâs selector.\\nThe template is \\nthe same as in the \\nReplicationController.\\n \\n',\n",

On Kubernetes nodes, you can\\nstill use systemd to run your system processes, but then you canât take advantage of all\\nthe features Kubernetes provides. \\n4.4.1\\nUsing a DaemonSet to run a pod on every node\\nTo run a pod on all cluster nodes, you create a DaemonSet object, which is much\\nlike a ReplicationController or a ReplicaSet, except that pods created by a Daemon-\\nSet already have a target node specified and skip the Kubernetes Scheduler. They\\narenât scattered around the cluster randomly. \\n A DaemonSet makes sure it creates as many pods as there are nodes and deploys\\neach one on its own node, as shown in figure 4.8.\\n Whereas a ReplicaSet (or ReplicationController) makes sure that a desired num-\\nber of pod replicas exist in the cluster, a DaemonSet doesnât have any notion of a\\ndesired replica count. It doesnât need it because its job is to ensure that a pod match-\\ning its pod selector is running on each node. \\n If a node goes down, the DaemonSet doesnât cause the pod to be created else-\\nwhere. But when a new node is added to the cluster, the DaemonSet immediately\\ndeploys a new pod instance to it. It also does the same if someone inadvertently\\ndeletes one of the pods, leaving the node without the DaemonSetâs pod. Like a Replica-\\nSet, a DaemonSet creates the pod from the pod template configured in it.\\n4.4.2\\nUsing a DaemonSet to run pods only on certain nodes\\nA DaemonSet deploys pods to all nodes in the cluster, unless you specify that the pods\\nshould only run on a subset of all the nodes. This is done by specifying the node-\\nSelector property in the pod template, which is part of the DaemonSet definition\\n(similar to the pod template in a ReplicaSet or ReplicationController). \\n Youâve already used node selectors to deploy a pod onto specific nodes in chapter 3.\\nA node selector in a DaemonSet is similarâit defines the nodes the DaemonSet must\\ndeploy its pods to. \\nNOTE\\nLater in the book, youâll learn that nodes can be made unschedulable,\\npreventing pods from being deployed to them. A DaemonSet will deploy pods\\neven to such nodes, because the unschedulable attribute is only used by the\\nScheduler, whereas pods managed by a DaemonSet bypass the Scheduler\\ncompletely. This is usually desirable, because DaemonSets are meant to run\\nsystem services, which usually need to run even on unschedulable nodes.\\nEXPLAINING DAEMONSETS WITH AN EXAMPLE\\nLetâs imagine having a daemon called ssd-monitor that needs to run on all nodes\\nthat contain a solid-state drive (SSD). Youâll create a DaemonSet that runs this dae-\\nmon on all nodes that are marked as having an SSD. The cluster administrators have\\nadded the disk=ssd label to all such nodes, so youâll create the DaemonSet with a\\nnode selector that only selects nodes with that label, as shown in figure 4.9.\\n \\n',\n",

Youâll have\\ncases where you only want to run a task that terminates after completing its work.\\nReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, and DaemonSets run continuous tasks that are\\nnever considered completed. Processes in such pods are restarted when they exit. But\\nin a completable task, after its process terminates, it should not be restarted again. \\n4.5.1\\nIntroducing the Job resource\\nKubernetes includes support for this through the Job resource, which is similar to the\\nother resources weâve discussed in this chapter, but it allows you to run a pod whose\\ncontainer isnât restarted when the process running inside finishes successfully. Once it\\ndoes, the pod is considered complete. \\n In the event of a node failure, the pods on that node that are managed by a Job will\\nbe rescheduled to other nodes the way ReplicaSet pods are. In the event of a failure of\\nthe process itself (when the process returns an error exit code), the Job can be config-\\nured to either restart the container or not.\\n Figure 4.10 shows how a pod created by a Job is rescheduled to a new node if the\\nnode it was initially scheduled to fails. The figure also shows both a managed pod,\\nwhich isnât rescheduled, and a pod backed by a ReplicaSet, which is.\\n For example, Jobs are useful for ad hoc tasks, where itâs crucial that the task fin-\\nishes properly. You could run the task in an unmanaged pod and wait for it to finish,\\nbut in the event of a node failing or the pod being evicted from the node while it is\\nperforming its task, youâd need to manually recreate it. Doing this manually doesnât\\nmake senseâespecially if the job takes hours to complete. \\n An example of such a job would be if you had data stored somewhere and you\\nneeded to transform and export it somewhere. Youâre going to emulate this by run-\\nning a container image built on top of the busybox image, which invokes the sleep\\ncommand for two minutes. Iâve already built the image and pushed it to Docker Hub,\\nbut you can peek into its Dockerfile in the bookâs code archive.\\n \\n',\n",

If the pod runs longer than that, the system will try to terminate it and will\\nmark the Job as failed. \\nNOTE\\nYou can configure how many times a Job can be retried before it is\\nmarked as failed by specifying the spec.backoffLimit field in the Job mani-\\nfest. If you don\\'t explicitly specify it, it defaults to 6.\\n4.6\\nScheduling Jobs to run periodically or once \\nin the future\\nJob resources run their pods immediately when you create the Job resource.

Kubernetes supports them, too.\\n A cron job in Kubernetes is configured by creating a CronJob resource. The\\nschedule for running the job is specified in the well-known cron format, so if youâre\\nfamiliar with regular cron jobs, youâll understand Kubernetesâ CronJobs in a matter\\nof seconds.\\n At the configured time, Kubernetes will create a Job resource according to the Job\\ntemplate configured in the CronJob object. When the Job resource is created, one or\\nmore pod replicas will be created and started according to the Jobâs pod template, as\\nyou learned in the previous section. Thereâs nothing more to it.\\n Letâs look at how to create CronJobs. \\n4.6.1\\nCreating a CronJob\\nImagine you need to run the batch job from your previous example every 15 minutes.\\nTo do that, create a CronJob resource with the following specification.\\n \\n \\n',\n",

You may have\\na hard requirement for the job to not be started too far over the scheduled time. In\\nthat case, you can specify a deadline by specifying the startingDeadlineSeconds field\\nin the CronJob specification as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: batch/v1beta1\\nkind: CronJob\\nspec:\\n  schedule: \"0,15,30,45 * * * *\"\\n  startingDeadlineSeconds: 15    \\n  ...\\nIn the example in listing 4.15, one of the times the job is supposed to run is 10:30:00.\\nIf it doesnât start by 10:30:15 for whatever reason, the job will not run and will be\\nshown as Failed. \\n In normal circumstances, a CronJob always creates only a single Job for each exe-\\ncution configured in the schedule, but it may happen that two Jobs are created at the\\nsame time, or none at all. To combat the first problem, your jobs should be idempo-\\ntent (running them multiple times instead of once shouldnât lead to unwanted\\nresults). For the second problem, make sure that the next job run performs any work\\nthat should have been done by the previous (missed) run.\\n4.7\\nSummary\\nYouâve now learned how to keep pods running and have them rescheduled in the\\nevent of node failures.

Clients shouldnât care how many pods are backing\\nthe service and what their IPs are. They shouldnât have to keep a list of all the\\nindividual IPs of pods. Instead, all those pods should be accessible through a\\nsingle IP address.\\nTo solve these problems, Kubernetes also provides another resource typeâServicesâ\\nthat weâll discuss in this chapter.\\n5.1\\nIntroducing services\\nA Kubernetes Service is a resource you create to make a single, constant point of\\nentry to a group of pods providing the same service. Each service has an IP address\\nand port that never change while the service exists. Clients can open connections to\\nthat IP and port, and those connections are then routed to one of the pods backing\\nthat service. This way, clients of a service donât need to know the location of individ-\\nual pods providing the service, allowing those pods to be moved around the cluster\\nat any time. \\nEXPLAINING SERVICES WITH AN EXAMPLE\\nLetâs revisit the example where you have a frontend web server and a backend data-\\nbase server. There may be multiple pods that all act as the frontend, but there may\\nonly be a single backend database pod. You need to solve two problems to make the\\nsystem function:\\n\\uf0a1External clients need to connect to the frontend pods without caring if thereâs\\nonly a single web server or hundreds.\\n\\uf0a1The frontend pods need to connect to the backend database. Because the data-\\nbase runs inside a pod, it may be moved around the cluster over time, causing\\nits IP address to change. You donât want to reconfigure the frontend pods every\\ntime the backend database is moved.\\nBy creating a service for the frontend pods and configuring it to be accessible from\\noutside the cluster, you expose a single, constant IP address through which external\\nclients can connect to the pods. Similarly, by also creating a service for the backend\\npod, you create a stable address for the backend pod. The service address doesnât\\n \\n',\n",

You instructed Kubernetes to execute the curl command inside the\\ncontainer of one of your pods. Curl sent an HTTP request to the service IP, which is\\nbacked by three pods. The Kubernetes service proxy intercepted the connection,\\nselected a random pod among the three pods, and forwarded the request to it. Node.js\\nrunning inside that pod then handled the request and returned an HTTP response con-\\ntaining the podâs name. Curl then printed the response to the standard output, which\\nwas intercepted and printed to its standard output on your local machine by kubectl.\\nWhy the double dash?\\nThe double dash (--) in the command signals the end of command options for\\nkubectl. Everything after the double dash is the command that should be executed\\ninside the pod. Using the double dash isnât necessary if the command has no\\narguments that start with a dash. But in your case, if you donât use the double dash\\nthere, the -s option would be interpreted as an option for kubectl exec and would\\nresult in the following strange and highly misleading error:\\n$ kubectl exec kubia-7nog1 curl -s http://10.111.249.153\\nThe connection to the server 10.111.249.153 was refused â did you \\nspecify the right host or port?\\nThis has nothing to do with your service refusing the connection. Itâs because\\nkubectl is not able to connect to an API server at 10.111.249.153 (the -s option\\nis used to tell kubectl to connect to a different API server than the default).\\n3.

This isnât much different from the actual main pro-\\ncess in the container talking to the service.\\nCONFIGURING SESSION AFFINITY ON THE SERVICE\\nIf you execute the same command a few more times, you should hit a different pod\\nwith every invocation, because the service proxy normally forwards each connection\\nto a randomly selected backing pod, even if the connections are coming from the\\nsame client. \\n If, on the other hand, you want all requests made by a certain client to be redi-\\nrected to the same pod every time, you can set the serviceâs sessionAffinity property\\nto ClientIP (instead of None, which is the default), as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service             \\nspec:\\n  sessionAffinity: ClientIP\\n  ...\\nThis makes the service proxy redirect all requests originating from the same client IP\\nto the same pod. As an exercise, you can create an additional service with session affin-\\nity set to ClientIP and try sending requests to it.\\n Kubernetes supports only two types of service session affinity: None and ClientIP.\\nYou may be surprised it doesnât have a cookie-based session affinity option, but you\\nneed to understand that Kubernetes services donât operate at the HTTP level. Services\\ndeal with TCP and UDP packets and donât care about the payload they carry. Because\\ncookies are a construct of the HTTP protocol, services donât know about them, which\\nexplains why session affinity cannot be based on cookies. \\nEXPOSING MULTIPLE PORTS IN THE SAME SERVICE\\nYour service exposes only a single port, but services can also support multiple ports. For\\nexample, if your pods listened on two portsâletâs say 8080 for HTTP and 8443 for\\nHTTPSâyou could use a single service to forward both port 80 and 443 to the podâs\\nports 8080 and 8443. You donât need to create two different services in such cases. Using\\na single, multi-port service exposes all the serviceâs ports through a single cluster IP.\\nNOTE\\nWhen creating a service with multiple ports, you must specify a name\\nfor each port.\\nThe spec for a multi-port service is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service             \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia              \\nListing 5.2\\nA example of a service with ClientIP session affinity configured\\nListing 5.3\\nSpecifying multiple ports in a service definition\\n \\n',\n",

The biggest benefit of doing so is\\nthat it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service\\nspec. Your pod currently uses port 8080 for http, but what if you later decide youâd\\nlike to move that to port 80? \\n If youâre using named ports, all you need to do is change the port number in the\\npod spec (while keeping the portâs name unchanged). As you spin up pods with the\\nnew ports, client connections will be forwarded to the appropriate port numbers,\\ndepending on the pod receiving the connection (port 8080 on old pods and port 80\\non the new ones).\\n5.1.2\\nDiscovering services\\nBy creating a service, you now have a single and stable IP address and port that you\\ncan hit to access your pods. This address will remain unchanged throughout the\\nwhole lifetime of the service. Pods behind this service may come and go, their IPs may\\nchange, their number can go up or down, but theyâll always be accessible through the\\nserviceâs single and constant IP address. \\n But how do the client pods know the IP and port of a service? Do you need to cre-\\nate the service first, then manually look up its IP address and pass the IP to the config-\\nuration options of the client pod? Not really. Kubernetes also provides ways for client\\npods to discover a serviceâs IP and port.\\nDISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\\nWhen a pod is started, Kubernetes initializes a set of environment variables pointing\\nto each service that exists at that moment. If you create the service before creating the\\nclient pods, processes in those pods can get the IP address and port of the service by\\ninspecting their environment variables. \\n Letâs see what those environment variables look like by examining the environment\\nof one of your running pods. Youâve already learned that you can use the kubectl exec\\ncommand to run a command in the pod, but because you created the service only\\nafter your pods had been created, the environment variables for the service couldnât\\nhave been set yet. Youâll need to address that first.\\n Before you can see environment variables for your service, you first need to delete\\nall the pods and let the ReplicationController create new ones. You may remember\\nyou can delete all pods without specifying their names like this:\\n$ kubectl delete po --all\\npod \"kubia-7nog1\" deleted\\npod \"kubia-bf50t\" deleted\\npod \"kubia-gzwli\" deleted\\nNow you can list the new pods (Iâm sure you know how to do that) and pick one as\\nyour target for the kubectl exec command. Once youâve selected your target pod,\\nyou can list environment variables by running the env command inside the container,\\nas shown in the following listing.\\n \\n',\n",

Among the variables that pertain to the\\nkubia service you created at the beginning of the chapter, youâll see the KUBIA_SERVICE\\n_HOST and the KUBIA_SERVICE_PORT environment variables, which hold the IP address\\nand port of the kubia service, respectively. \\n Turning back to the frontend-backend example we started this chapter with, when\\nyou have a frontend pod that requires the use of a backend database server pod, you\\ncan expose the backend pod through a service called backend-database and then\\nhave the frontend pod look up its IP address and port through the environment vari-\\nables BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_HOST and BACKEND_DATABASE_SERVICE_PORT.\\nNOTE\\nDashes in the service name are converted to underscores and all let-\\nters are uppercased when the service name is used as the prefix in the envi-\\nronment variableâs name. \\nEnvironment variables are one way of looking up the IP and port of a service, but isnât\\nthis usually the domain of DNS? Why doesnât Kubernetes include a DNS server and\\nallow you to look up service IPs through DNS instead? As it turns out, it does!\\nDISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH DNS\\nRemember in chapter 3 when you listed pods in the kube-system namespace? One of\\nthe pods was called kube-dns. The kube-system namespace also includes a corre-\\nsponding service with the same name.\\n As the name suggests, the pod runs a DNS server, which all other pods running in\\nthe cluster are automatically configured to use (Kubernetes does that by modifying\\neach containerâs /etc/resolv.conf file). Any DNS query performed by a process run-\\nning in a pod will be handled by Kubernetesâ own DNS server, which knows all the ser-\\nvices running in your system. \\nNOTE\\nWhether a pod uses the internal DNS server or not is configurable\\nthrough the dnsPolicy property in each podâs spec.\\nEach service gets a DNS entry in the internal DNS server, and client pods that know\\nthe name of the service can access it through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN)\\ninstead of resorting to environment variables. \\nListing 5.6\\nService-related environment variables in a container\\nHereâs the cluster \\nIP of the service.\\nAnd hereâs the port the \\nservice is available on.\\n \\n',\n",

If the service is\\nusing a standard port (for example, 80 for HTTP or 5432 for Postgres), that\\nshouldnât be a problem. If not, the client can get the port number from the\\nenvironment variable.\\nConnecting to a service can be even simpler than that. You can omit the svc.cluster\\n.local suffix and even the namespace, when the frontend pod is in the same name-\\nspace as the database pod. You can thus refer to the service simply as backend-\\ndatabase. Thatâs incredibly simple, right?\\n Letâs try this. Youâll try to access the kubia service through its FQDN instead of its\\nIP. Again, youâll need to do that inside an existing pod. You already know how to use\\nkubectl exec to run a single command in a podâs container, but this time, instead of\\nrunning the curl command directly, youâll run the bash shell instead, so you can then\\nrun multiple commands in the container. This is similar to what you did in chapter 2\\nwhen you entered the container you ran with Docker by using the docker exec -it\\nbash command. \\nRUNNING A SHELL IN A PODâS CONTAINER\\nYou can use the kubectl exec command to run bash (or any other shell) inside a\\npodâs container. This way youâre free to explore the container as long as you want,\\nwithout having to perform a kubectl exec for every command you want to run.\\nNOTE\\nThe shellâs binary executable must be available in the container image\\nfor this to work.\\nTo use the shell properly, you need to pass the -it option to kubectl exec:\\n$ kubectl exec -it kubia-3inly bash\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# \\nYouâre now inside the container. You can use the curl command to access the kubia\\nservice in any of the following ways:\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\\nYouâve hit kubia-5asi2\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# curl http://kubia.default\\nYouâve hit kubia-3inly\\n \\n',\n",

You know how to create services now, so youâll soon\\ncreate your own. But what if, for whatever reason, you canât access your service?\\n Youâll probably try to figure out whatâs wrong by entering an existing pod and try-\\ning to access the service like you did in the last example. Then, if you still canât access\\nthe service with a simple curl command, maybe youâll try to ping the service IP to see\\nif itâs up. Letâs try that now:\\nroot@kubia-3inly:/# ping kubia\\nPING kubia.default.svc.cluster.local (10.111.249.153): 56 data bytes\\n^C--- kubia.default.svc.cluster.local ping statistics ---\\n54 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100% packet loss\\nHmm. curl-ing the service works, but pinging it doesnât. Thatâs because the serviceâs\\ncluster IP is a virtual IP, and only has meaning when combined with the service port.\\nWeâll explain what that means and how services work in chapter 11. I wanted to men-\\ntion that here because itâs the first thing users do when they try to debug a broken\\nservice and it catches most of them off guard.\\n5.2\\nConnecting to services living outside the cluster\\nUp to now, weâve talked about services backed by one or more pods running inside\\nthe cluster. But cases exist when youâd like to expose external services through the\\nKubernetes services feature. Instead of having the service redirect connections to\\npods in the cluster, you want it to redirect to external IP(s) and port(s). \\n This allows you to take advantage of both service load balancing and service discov-\\nery. Client pods running in the cluster can connect to the external service like they\\nconnect to internal services.\\n5.2.1\\nIntroducing service endpoints\\nBefore going into how to do this, let me first shed more light on services. Services\\ndonât link to pods directly. Instead, a resource sits in betweenâthe Endpoints\\nresource. You may have already noticed endpoints if you used the kubectl describe\\ncommand on your service, as shown in the following listing.\\n \\n',\n",

This means a service IP address can remain\\nconstant while the actual implementation of the service is changed. \\n5.2.3\\nCreating an alias for an external service\\nInstead of exposing an external service by manually configuring the serviceâs End-\\npoints, a simpler method allows you to refer to an external service by its fully qualified\\ndomain name (FQDN).\\nCREATING AN EXTERNALNAME SERVICE\\nTo create a service that serves as an alias for an external service, you create a Service\\nresource with the type field set to ExternalName. For example, letâs imagine thereâs a\\npublic API available at api.somecompany.com. You can define a service that points to\\nit as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n  name: external-service\\nspec:\\n  type: ExternalName                       \\n  externalName: someapi.somecompany.com     \\n  ports:\\n  - port: 80\\nAfter the service is created, pods can connect to the external service through the\\nexternal-service.default.svc.cluster.local domain name (or even external-\\nservice) instead of using the serviceâs actual FQDN. This hides the actual service\\nname and its location from pods consuming the service, allowing you to modify the\\nservice definition and point it to a different service any time later, by only changing\\nthe externalName attribute or by changing the type back to ClusterIP and creating\\nan Endpoints object for the serviceâeither manually or by specifying a label selector\\non the service and having it created automatically.\\n ExternalName services are implemented solely at the DNS levelâa simple CNAME\\nDNS record is created for the service. Therefore, clients connecting to the service will\\nconnect to the external service directly, bypassing the service proxy completely. For\\nthis reason, these types of services donât even get a cluster IP. \\nNOTE\\nA CNAME record points to a fully qualified domain name instead of a\\nnumeric IP address.\\n5.3\\nExposing services to external clients\\nUp to now, weâve only talked about how services can be consumed by pods from inside\\nthe cluster. But youâll also want to expose certain services, such as frontend webserv-\\ners, to the outside, so external clients can access them, as depicted in figure 5.5.\\nListing 5.10\\nAn ExternalName-type service: external-service-externalname.yaml\\nService type is set \\nto ExternalName\\nThe fully qualified domain \\nname of the actual service\\n \\n',\n",

The service isnât accessible only at the\\ninternal cluster IP and port, but also through a dedicated port on all nodes. \\n\\uf0a1Setting the service type to LoadBalancer, an extension of the NodePort typeâThis\\nmakes the service accessible through a dedicated load balancer, provisioned\\nfrom the cloud infrastructure Kubernetes is running on. The load balancer redi-\\nrects traffic to the node port across all the nodes. Clients connect to the service\\nthrough the load balancerâs IP.\\n\\uf0a1Creating an Ingress resource, a radically different mechanism for exposing multiple ser-\\nvices through a single IP addressâIt operates at the HTTP level (network layer 7)\\nand can thus offer more features than layer 4 services can. Weâll explain Ingress\\nresources in section 5.4. \\n5.3.1\\nUsing a NodePort service\\nThe first method of exposing a set of pods to external clients is by creating a service\\nand setting its type to NodePort. By creating a NodePort service, you make Kubernetes\\nreserve a port on all its nodes (the same port number is used across all of them) and\\nforward incoming connections to the pods that are part of the service. \\n This is similar to a regular service (their actual type is ClusterIP), but a NodePort\\nservice can be accessed not only through the serviceâs internal cluster IP, but also\\nthrough any nodeâs IP and the reserved node port. \\n This will make more sense when you try interacting with a NodePort service.\\nCREATING A NODEPORT SERVICE\\nYouâll now create a NodePort service to see how you can use it.

The browser is using keep-alive connections and\\nsends all its requests through a single connection, whereas curl opens a new\\nconnection every time.

From there, the connection is for-\\nwarded to one of the pod instances.\\n As already mentioned, a LoadBalancer-type service is a NodePort service with an\\nadditional infrastructure-provided load balancer. If you use kubectl describe to dis-\\nplay additional info about the service, youâll see that a node port has been selected for\\nthe service. If you were to open the firewall for this port, the way you did in the previ-\\nous section about NodePort services, you could access the service through the node\\nIPs as well.\\nTIP\\nIf youâre using Minikube, even though the load balancer will never be\\nprovisioned, you can still access the service through the node port (at the\\nMinikube VMâs IP address).\\n5.3.3\\nUnderstanding the peculiarities of external connections\\nYou must be aware of several things related to externally originating connections to\\nservices. \\nUNDERSTANDING AND PREVENTING UNNECESSARY NETWORK HOPS\\nWhen an external client connects to a service through the node port (this also\\nincludes cases when it goes through the load balancer first), the randomly chosen\\npod may or may not be running on the same node that received the connection. An\\nadditional network hop is required to reach the pod, but this may not always be\\ndesirable. \\n You can prevent this additional hop by configuring the service to redirect external\\ntraffic only to pods running on the node that received the connection. This is done by\\nsetting the externalTrafficPolicy field in the serviceâs spec section:\\nspec:\\n  externalTrafficPolicy: Local\\n  ...\\nIf a service definition includes this setting and an external connection is opened\\nthrough the serviceâs node port, the service proxy will choose a locally running pod. If\\nno local pods exist, the connection will hang (it wonât be forwarded to a random\\nglobal pod, the way connections are when not using the annotation). You therefore\\nneed to ensure the load balancer forwards connections only to nodes that have at\\nleast one such pod.\\n Using this annotation also has other drawbacks. Normally, connections are spread\\nevenly across all the pods, but when using this annotation, thatâs no longer the case.\\n Imagine having two nodes and three pods. Letâs say node A runs one pod and\\nnode B runs the other two. If the load balancer spreads connections evenly across the\\ntwo nodes, the pod on node A will receive 50% of all connections, but the two pods on\\nnode B will only receive 25% each, as shown in figure 5.8.\\n \\n',\n",

But when the connection is received through a\\nnode port, the packetsâ source IP is changed, because Source Network Address Trans-\\nlation (SNAT) is performed on the packets. \\n The backing pod canât see the actual clientâs IP, which may be a problem for some\\napplications that need to know the clientâs IP. In the case of a web server, for example,\\nthis means the access log wonât show the browserâs IP.\\n The Local external traffic policy described in the previous section affects the pres-\\nervation of the clientâs IP, because thereâs no additional hop between the node receiv-\\ning the connection and the node hosting the target pod (SNAT isnât performed).\\n5.4\\nExposing services externally through an Ingress \\nresource\\nYouâve now seen two ways of exposing a service to clients outside the cluster, but\\nanother method existsâcreating an Ingress resource.\\nDEFINITION\\nIngress (noun)âThe act of going in or entering; the right to\\nenter; a means or place of entering; entryway. \\nLet me first explain why you need another way to access Kubernetes services from the\\noutside. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHY INGRESSES ARE NEEDED\\nOne important reason is that each LoadBalancer service requires its own load bal-\\nancer with its own public IP address, whereas an Ingress only requires one, even when\\nproviding access to dozens of services.

The client first performed a DNS lookup of kubia.example.com, and the\\nDNS server (or the local operating system) returned the IP of the Ingress controller.\\nThe client then sent an HTTP request to the Ingress controller and specified\\nkubia.example.com in the Host header. From that header, the controller determined\\nwhich service the client is trying to access, looked up the pod IPs through the End-\\npoints object associated with the service, and forwarded the clientâs request to one of\\nthe pods.\\n As you can see, the Ingress controller didnât forward the request to the service. It\\nonly used it to select a pod. Most, if not all, controllers work like this. \\n \\n\",\n",

DNS needs to point both the foo.example.com and the bar.exam-\\nple.com domain names to the Ingress controllerâs IP address. \\n5.4.4\\nConfiguring Ingress to handle TLS traffic\\nYouâve seen how an Ingress forwards HTTP traffic. But what about HTTPS? Letâs take\\na quick look at how to configure Ingress to support TLS. \\nCREATING A TLS CERTIFICATE FOR THE INGRESS\\nWhen a client opens a TLS connection to an Ingress controller, the controller termi-\\nnates the TLS connection. The communication between the client and the controller\\nis encrypted, whereas the communication between the controller and the backend\\npod isnât. The application running in the pod doesnât need to support TLS. For exam-\\nple, if the pod runs a web server, it can accept only HTTP traffic and let the Ingress\\ncontroller take care of everything related to TLS. To enable the controller to do that,\\nyou need to attach a certificate and a private key to the Ingress. The two need to be\\nstored in a Kubernetes resource called a Secret, which is then referenced in the\\nIngress manifest. Weâll explain Secrets in detail in chapter 7. For now, youâll create the\\nSecret without paying too much attention to it.\\n First, you need to create the private key and certificate:\\n$ openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048\\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj \\nâ¥ /CN=kubia.example.com\\nListing 5.15\\nIngress exposing multiple services on different hosts\\nRequests for \\nfoo.example.com will be \\nrouted to service foo.\\nRequests for \\nbar.example.com will be \\nrouted to service bar.\\n \\n',\n",

Such a detailed readiness probe, which\\ntakes the appâs specifics into account, is the app developerâs responsibility. \\nTYPES OF READINESS PROBES\\nLike liveness probes, three types of readiness probes exist:\\n\\uf0a1An Exec probe, where a process is executed. The containerâs status is deter-\\nmined by the processâ exit status code.\\n\\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe, which sends an HTTP GET request to the container and\\nthe HTTP status code of the response determines whether the container is\\nready or not.\\n\\uf0a1A TCP Socket probe, which opens a TCP connection to a specified port of the\\ncontainer. If the connection is established, the container is considered ready.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE OPERATION OF READINESS PROBES\\nWhen a container is started, Kubernetes can be configured to wait for a configurable\\namount of time to pass before performing the first readiness check. After that, it\\ninvokes the probe periodically and acts based on the result of the readiness probe. If a\\npod reports that itâs not ready, itâs removed from the service. If the pod then becomes\\nready again, itâs re-added. \\n Unlike liveness probes, if a container fails the readiness check, it wonât be killed or\\nrestarted. This is an important distinction between liveness and readiness probes.\\nLiveness probes keep pods healthy by killing off unhealthy containers and replacing\\nthem with new, healthy ones, whereas readiness probes make sure that only pods that\\nare ready to serve requests receive them. This is mostly necessary during container\\nstart up, but itâs also useful after the container has been running for a while. \\n As you can see in figure 5.11, if a podâs readiness probe fails, the pod is removed\\nfrom the Endpoints object. Clients connecting to the service will not be redirected to\\nthe pod. The effect is the same as when the pod doesnât match the serviceâs label\\nselector at all.\\nEndpoints\\nService\\nSelector: app=kubia\\napp: kubia\\nPod: kubia-q3vkg\\napp: kubia\\nPod: kubia-k0xz6\\napp: kubia\\nPod: kubia-53thy\\nNot ready\\nThis pod is no longer\\nan endpoint, because its\\nreadiness probe has failed.\\nFigure 5.11\\nA pod whose readiness probe fails is removed as an endpoint of a service.\\n \\n',\n",

The file doesnât exist yet, so all the\\npods should now report not being ready, right? Well, not exactly. As you may remem-\\nber from the previous chapter, changing a ReplicationControllerâs pod template has\\nno effect on existing pods. \\n In other words, all your existing pods still have no readiness probe defined. You\\ncan see this by listing the pods with kubectl get pods and looking at the READY col-\\numn. You need to delete the pods and have them re-created by the Replication-\\nController. The new pods will fail the readiness check and wonât be included as\\nendpoints of the service until you create the /var/ready file in each of them. \\nOBSERVING AND MODIFYING THE PODSâ READINESS STATUS\\nList the pods again and inspect whether theyâre ready or not:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-2r1qb   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nkubia-3rax1   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nkubia-3yw4s   0/1       Running   0          1m\\nThe READY column shows that none of the containers are ready. Now make the readi-\\nness probe of one of them start returning success by creating the /var/ready file,\\nwhose existence makes your mock readiness probe succeed:\\n$ kubectl exec kubia-2r1qb -- touch /var/ready\\nYouâve used the kubectl exec command to execute the touch command inside the\\ncontainer of the kubia-2r1qb pod. The touch command creates the file if it doesnât\\nyet exist. The podâs readiness probe command should now exit with status code 0,\\nwhich means the probe is successful, and the pod should now be shown as ready. Letâs\\nsee if it is:\\n$ kubectl get po kubia-2r1qb\\nNAME          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-2r1qb   0/1       Running   0          2m\\nThe pod still isnât ready. Is there something wrong or is this the expected result? Take\\na more detailed look at the pod with kubectl describe. The output should contain\\nthe following line:\\nReadiness: exec [ls /var/ready] delay=0s timeout=1s period=10s #success=1\\nâ¥ #failure=3\\nThe readiness probe is checked periodicallyâevery 10 seconds by default. The pod\\nisnât ready because the readiness probe hasnât been invoked yet. But in 10 seconds at\\nthe latest, the pod should become ready and its IP should be listed as the only end-\\npoint of the service (run kubectl get endpoints kubia-loadbalancer to confirm). \\n \\n',\n",

First, if you donât add a readiness probe to your pods, theyâll\\nbecome service endpoints almost immediately. If your application takes too long to\\nstart listening for incoming connections, client requests hitting the service will be for-\\nwarded to the pod while itâs still starting up and not ready to accept incoming connec-\\ntions. Clients will therefore see âConnection refusedâ types of errors. \\nTIP\\nYou should always define a readiness probe, even if itâs as simple as send-\\ning an HTTP request to the base URL. \\nDONâT INCLUDE POD SHUTDOWN LOGIC INTO YOUR READINESS PROBES\\nThe other thing I need to mention applies to the other end of the podâs life (pod\\nshutdown) and is also related to clients experiencing connection errors. \\n When a pod is being shut down, the app running in it usually stops accepting con-\\nnections as soon as it receives the termination signal. Because of this, you might think\\nyou need to make your readiness probe start failing as soon as the shutdown proce-\\ndure is initiated, ensuring the pod is removed from all services itâs part of. But thatâs\\nnot necessary, because Kubernetes removes the pod from all services as soon as you\\ndelete the pod.\\n \\n',\n",

Each connection to the\\nservice is forwarded to one randomly selected backing pod. But what if the client\\nneeds to connect to all of those pods? What if the backing pods themselves need to\\neach connect to all the other backing pods? Connecting through the service clearly\\nisnât the way to do this. What is?\\n For a client to connect to all pods, it needs to figure out the the IP of each individ-\\nual pod. One option is to have the client call the Kubernetes API server and get the\\nlist of pods and their IP addresses through an API call, but because you should always\\nstrive to keep your apps Kubernetes-agnostic, using the API server isnât ideal. \\n Luckily, Kubernetes allows clients to discover pod IPs through DNS lookups. Usually,\\nwhen you perform a DNS lookup for a service, the DNS server returns a single IPâthe\\nserviceâs cluster IP. But if you tell Kubernetes you donât need a cluster IP for your service\\n(you do this by setting the clusterIP field to None in the service specification), the DNS\\nserver will return the pod IPs instead of the single service IP.\\n Instead of returning a single DNS A record, the DNS server will return multiple A\\nrecords for the service, each pointing to the IP of an individual pod backing the ser-\\nvice at that moment. Clients can therefore do a simple DNS A record lookup and get\\nthe IPs of all the pods that are part of the service. The client can then use that infor-\\nmation to connect to one, many, or all of them.\\n5.6.1\\nCreating a headless service\\nSetting the clusterIP field in a service spec to None makes the service headless, as\\nKubernetes wonât assign it a cluster IP through which clients could connect to the\\npods backing it. \\n Youâll create a headless service called kubia-headless now.

I say âpart ofâ because your pods contain a readi-\\nness probe, so only pods that are ready will be listed as endpoints of the service.\\nBefore continuing, please make sure at least two pods report being ready, by creating\\nthe /var/ready file, as in the previous example:\\n$ kubectl exec <pod name> -- touch /var/ready\\n5.6.2\\nDiscovering pods through DNS\\nWith your pods ready, you can now try performing a DNS lookup to see if you get the\\nactual pod IPs or not. Youâll need to perform the lookup from inside one of the pods.\\nUnfortunately, your kubia container image doesnât include the nslookup (or the dig)\\nbinary, so you canât use it to perform the DNS lookup.\\n All youâre trying to do is perform a DNS lookup from inside a pod running in the\\ncluster. Why not run a new pod based on an image that contains the binaries you\\nneed? To perform DNS-related actions, you can use the tutum/dnsutils container\\nimage, which is available on Docker Hub and contains both the nslookup and the dig\\nbinaries. To run the pod, you can go through the whole process of creating a YAML\\nmanifest for it and passing it to kubectl create, but thatâs too much work, right?\\nLuckily, thereâs a faster way.\\nRUNNING A POD WITHOUT WRITING A YAML MANIFEST\\nIn chapter 1, you already created pods without writing a YAML manifest by using the\\nkubectl run command. But this time you want to create only a podâyou donât need\\nto create a ReplicationController to manage the pod. You can do that like this:\\n$ kubectl run dnsutils --image=tutum/dnsutils --generator=run-pod/v1\\nâ¥ --command -- sleep infinity\\npod \"dnsutils\" created\\nThe trick is in the --generator=run-pod/v1 option, which tells kubectl to create the\\npod directly, without any kind of ReplicationController or similar behind it. \\nUNDERSTANDING DNS A RECORDS RETURNED FOR A HEADLESS SERVICE\\nLetâs use the newly created pod to perform a DNS lookup:\\n$ kubectl exec dnsutils nslookup kubia-headless\\n...\\nName:    kubia-headless.default.svc.cluster.local\\nAddress: 10.108.1.4 \\nName:    kubia-headless.default.svc.cluster.local\\nAddress: 10.108.2.5 \\nThe DNS server returns two different IPs for the kubia-headless.default.svc\\n.cluster.local FQDN. Those are the IPs of the two pods that are reporting being\\nready. You can confirm this by listing pods with kubectl get pods -o wide, which\\nshows the podsâ IPs. \\n \\n',\n",

Even with a headless service, clients can con-\\nnect to its pods by connecting to the serviceâs DNS name, as they can with regular ser-\\nvices. But with headless services, because DNS returns the podsâ IPs, clients connect\\ndirectly to the pods, instead of through the service proxy. \\nNOTE\\nA headless services still provides load balancing across pods, but through\\nthe DNS round-robin mechanism instead of through the service proxy.\\n5.6.3\\nDiscovering all podsâeven those that arenât ready\\nYouâve seen that only pods that are ready become endpoints of services. But some-\\ntimes you want to use the service discovery mechanism to find all pods matching the\\nserviceâs label selector, even those that arenât ready. \\n Luckily, you donât have to resort to querying the Kubernetes API server. You can\\nuse the DNS lookup mechanism to find even those unready pods. To tell Kubernetes\\nyou want all pods added to a service, regardless of the podâs readiness status, you must\\nadd the following annotation to the service:\\nkind: Service\\nmetadata:\\n  annotations:\\n    service.alpha.kubernetes.io/tolerate-unready-endpoints: \"true\"\\nWARNING\\nAs the annotation name suggests, as Iâm writing this, this is an alpha\\nfeature. The Kubernetes Service API already supports a new service spec field\\ncalled publishNotReadyAddresses, which will replace the tolerate-unready-\\nendpoints annotation. In Kubernetes version 1.9.0, the field is not honored yet\\n(the annotation is what determines whether unready endpoints are included in\\nthe DNS or not). Check the documentation to see whether thatâs changed.\\n5.7\\nTroubleshooting services\\nServices are a crucial Kubernetes concept and the source of frustration for many\\ndevelopers. Iâve seen many developers lose heaps of time figuring out why they canât\\nconnect to their pods through the service IP or FQDN.

Combine this with the fact that containers in a pod get restarted (either\\nbecause the process died or because the liveness probe signaled to Kubernetes that\\nthe container wasnât healthy anymore) and youâll realize that the new container will\\nnot see anything that was written to the filesystem by the previous container, even\\nthough the newly started container runs in the same pod.\\n In certain scenarios you want the new container to continue where the last one fin-\\nished, such as when restarting a process on a physical machine. You may not need (or\\nwant) the whole filesystem to be persisted, but you do want to preserve the directories\\nthat hold actual data.\\n Kubernetes provides this by defining storage volumes. They arenât top-level resources\\nlike pods, but are instead defined as a part of a pod and share the same lifecycle as the\\npod. This means a volume is created when the pod is started and is destroyed when\\nthe pod is deleted. Because of this, a volumeâs contents will persist across container\\nrestarts. After a container is restarted, the new container can see all the files that were\\nwritten to the volume by the previous container. Also, if a pod contains multiple con-\\ntainers, the volume can be used by all of them at once. \\n6.1\\nIntroducing volumes\\nKubernetes volumes are a component of a pod and are thus defined in the podâs spec-\\nificationâmuch like containers. They arenât a standalone Kubernetes object and can-\\nnot be created or deleted on their own. A volume is available to all containers in the\\npod, but it must be mounted in each container that needs to access it. In each con-\\ntainer, you can mount the volume in any location of its filesystem.\\n6.1.1\\nExplaining volumes in an example\\nImagine you have a pod with three containers (shown in figure 6.1). One container\\nruns a web server that serves HTML pages from the /var/htdocs directory and stores\\nthe access log to /var/logs. The second container runs an agent that creates HTML\\nfiles and stores them in /var/html. The third container processes the logs it finds in\\nthe /var/logs directory (rotates them, compresses them, analyzes them, or whatever).\\n Each container has a nicely defined single responsibility, but on its own each con-\\ntainer wouldnât be of much use. Creating a pod with these three containers without\\nthem sharing disk storage doesnât make any sense, because the content generator\\nwould write the generated HTML files inside its own container and the web server\\ncouldnât access those files, as it runs in a separate isolated container. Instead, it would\\nserve an empty directory or whatever you put in the /var/htdocs directory in its con-\\ntainer image. Similarly, the log rotator would never have anything to do, because its\\n/var/logs directory would always remain empty with nothing writing logs there. A pod\\nwith these three containers and no volumes basically does nothing.\\n But if you add two volumes to the pod and mount them at appropriate paths inside\\nthe three containers, as shown in figure 6.2, youâve created a system thatâs much more\\n \\n',\n",

When you do that, the contents of the mounted filesystem are accessi-\\nble in the directory itâs mounted into. By mounting the same volume into two contain-\\ners, they can operate on the same files. In your case, youâre mounting two volumes in\\nthree containers. By doing this, your three containers can work together and do some-\\nthing useful. Let me explain how.\\n First, the pod has a volume called publicHtml. This volume is mounted in the Web-\\nServer container at /var/htdocs, because thatâs the directory the web server serves\\nfiles from. The same volume is also mounted in the ContentAgent container, but at\\n/var/html, because thatâs where the agent writes the files to. By mounting this single vol-\\nume like that, the web server will now serve the content generated by the content agent.\\n Similarly, the pod also has a volume called logVol for storing logs. This volume is\\nmounted at /var/logs in both the WebServer and the LogRotator containers. Note\\nthat it isnât mounted in the ContentAgent container. The container cannot access its\\nfiles, even though the container and the volume are part of the same pod. Itâs not\\nenough to define a volume in the pod; you need to define a VolumeMount inside the\\ncontainerâs spec also, if you want the container to be able to access it.\\n The two volumes in this example can both initially be empty, so you can use a type\\nof volume called emptyDir. Kubernetes also supports other types of volumes that are\\neither populated during initialization of the volume from an external source, or an\\nexisting directory is mounted inside the volume. This process of populating or mount-\\ning a volume is performed before the podâs containers are started. \\n A volume is bound to the lifecycle of a pod and will stay in existence only while the\\npod exists, but depending on the volume type, the volumeâs files may remain intact\\neven after the pod and volume disappear, and can later be mounted into a new vol-\\nume. Letâs see what types of volumes exist.\\n6.1.2\\nIntroducing available volume types\\nA wide variety of volume types is available. Several are generic, while others are spe-\\ncific to the actual storage technologies used underneath. Donât worry if youâve never\\nheard of those technologiesâI hadnât heard of at least half of them. Youâll probably\\nonly use volume types for the technologies you already know and use. Hereâs a list of\\nseveral of the available volume types:\\n\\uf0a1\\nemptyDirâA simple empty directory used for storing transient data.\\n\\uf0a1\\nhostPathâUsed for mounting directories from the worker nodeâs filesystem\\ninto the pod.\\n\\uf0a1\\ngitRepoâA volume initialized by checking out the contents of a Git repository.\\n\\uf0a1\\nnfsâAn NFS share mounted into the pod.\\n\\uf0a1\\ngcePersistentDisk (Google Compute Engine Persistent Disk), awsElastic-\\nBlockStore (Amazon Web Services Elastic Block Store Volume), azureDisk\\n(Microsoft Azure Disk Volume)âUsed for mounting cloud provider-specific\\nstorage.\\n \\n',\n",

(Weâll talk about them in the last section of this chapter.)\\nThese volume types serve various purposes. Youâll learn about some of them in the\\nfollowing sections. Special types of volumes (secret, downwardAPI, configMap) are\\ncovered in the next two chapters, because they arenât used for storing data, but for\\nexposing Kubernetes metadata to apps running in the pod. \\n A single pod can use multiple volumes of different types at the same time, and, as\\nweâve mentioned before, each of the podâs containers can either have the volume\\nmounted or not.\\n6.2\\nUsing volumes to share data between containers\\nAlthough a volume can prove useful even when used by a single container, letâs first\\nfocus on how itâs used for sharing data between multiple containers in a pod.\\n6.2.1\\nUsing an emptyDir volume\\nThe simplest volume type is the emptyDir volume, so letâs look at it in the first exam-\\nple of how to define a volume in a pod. As the name suggests, the volume starts out as\\nan empty directory. The app running inside the pod can then write any files it needs\\nto it. Because the volumeâs lifetime is tied to that of the pod, the volumeâs contents are\\nlost when the pod is deleted.\\n An emptyDir volume is especially useful for sharing files between containers\\nrunning in the same pod. But it can also be used by a single container for when a con-\\ntainer needs to write data to disk temporarily, such as when performing a sort\\noperation on a large dataset, which canât fit into the available memory. The data could\\nalso be written to the containerâs filesystem itself (remember the top read-write layer\\nin a container?), but subtle differences exist between the two options. A containerâs\\nfilesystem may not even be writable (weâll talk about this toward the end of the book),\\nso writing to a mounted volume might be the only option. \\nUSING AN EMPTYDIR VOLUME IN A POD\\nLetâs revisit the previous example where a web server, a content agent, and a log rota-\\ntor share two volumes, but letâs simplify a bit. Youâll build a pod with only the web\\nserver container and the content agent and a single volume for the HTML. \\n Youâll use Nginx as the web server and the UNIX fortune command to generate\\nthe HTML content. The fortune command prints out a random quote every time you\\nrun it. Youâll create a script that invokes the fortune command every 10 seconds and\\nstores its output in index.html. Youâll find an existing Nginx image available on\\n \\n',\n",

Because the volume is mounted at /var/htdocs, the index.html file is writ-\\nten to the volume instead of the containerâs top layer. As soon as the web-server con-\\ntainer starts, it starts serving whatever HTML files are in the /usr/share/nginx/html\\ndirectory (this is the default directory Nginx serves files from).

To do this, set the emptyDirâs medium to Memory like this:\\nvolumes:\\n  - name: html\\n    emptyDir:\\n      medium: Memory    \\nAn emptyDir volume is the simplest type of volume, but other types build upon it.\\nAfter the empty directory is created, they populate it with data. One such volume type\\nis the gitRepo volume type, which weâll introduce next.\\n6.2.2\\nUsing a Git repository as the starting point for a volume \\nA gitRepo volume is basically an emptyDir volume that gets populated by cloning a\\nGit repository and checking out a specific revision when the pod is starting up (but\\nbefore its containers are created).

The files in the volume will not be updated when you push\\nadditional commits to the Git repository. However, if your pod is managed by\\na ReplicationController, deleting the pod will result in a new pod being cre-\\nated and this new podâs volume will then contain the latest commits. \\nFor example, you can use a Git repository to store static HTML files of your website\\nand create a pod containing a web server container and a gitRepo volume.

If you\\ndonât use Git locally, you can edit the file on GitHub directlyâclick on the file in your\\nGitHub repository to open it and then click on the pencil icon to start editing it.\\nChange the text and then commit the changes by clicking the button at the bottom.\\n The master branch of the Git repository now includes the changes you made to the\\nHTML file. These changes will not be visible on your Nginx web server yet, because\\nthe gitRepo volume isnât kept in sync with the Git repository. You can confirm this by\\nhitting the pod again. \\n To see the new version of the website, you need to delete the pod and create\\nit again. Instead of having to delete the pod every time you make changes, you could\\nrun an additional process, which keeps your volume in sync with the Git repository.\\nI wonât explain in detail how to do this. Instead, try doing this yourself as an exer-\\ncise, but here are a few pointers.\\nINTRODUCING SIDECAR CONTAINERS\\nThe Git sync process shouldnât run in the same container as the Nginx web server, but\\nin a second container: a sidecar container. A sidecar container is a container that aug-\\nments the operation of the main container of the pod. You add a sidecar to a pod so\\nyou can use an existing container image instead of cramming additional logic into the\\nmain appâs code, which would make it overly complex and less reusable. \\n To find an existing container image, which keeps a local directory synchronized\\nwith a Git repository, go to Docker Hub and search for âgit sync.â Youâll find many\\nimages that do that. Then use the image in a new container in the pod from the previ-\\nous example, mount the podâs existing gitRepo volume in the new container, and\\nconfigure the Git sync container to keep the files in sync with your Git repo. If you set\\neverything up correctly, you should see that the files the web server is serving are kept\\nin sync with your GitHub repo. \\nNOTE\\nAn example in chapter 18 includes using a Git sync container like the\\none explained here, so you can wait until you reach chapter 18 and follow the\\nstep-by-step instructions then instead of doing this exercise on your own now. \\nUSING A GITREPO VOLUME WITH PRIVATE GIT REPOSITORIES\\nThereâs one other reason for having to resort to Git sync sidecar containers. We\\nhavenât talked about whether you can use a gitRepo volume with a private Git repo. It\\nturns out you canât. The current consensus among Kubernetes developers is to keep\\nthe gitRepo volume simple and not add any support for cloning private repositories\\nthrough the SSH protocol, because that would require adding additional config\\noptions to the gitRepo volume. \\n If you want to clone a private Git repo into your container, you should use a git-\\nsync sidecar or a similar method instead of a gitRepo volume.\\n \\n',\n",

Because the volumeâs contents are stored on a specific\\nnodeâs filesystem, when the database pod gets rescheduled to another node, it will no\\nlonger see the data. This explains why itâs not a good idea to use a hostPath volume\\nfor regular pods, because it makes the pod sensitive to what node itâs scheduled to.\\n6.3.2\\nExamining system pods that use hostPath volumes\\nLetâs see how a hostPath volume can be used properly. Instead of creating a new pod,\\nletâs see if any existing system-wide pods are already using this type of volume. As you\\nmay remember from one of the previous chapters, several such pods are running in\\nthe kube-system namespace. Letâs list them again:\\n$ kubectl get pod s --namespace kube-system\\nNAME                          READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nfluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-9a3e   1/1       Running   1          4d\\nfluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-e2vz   1/1       Running   1          31d\\n...\\nPick the first one and see what kinds of volumes it uses (shown in the following listing).\\n$ kubectl describe po fluentd-kubia-4ebc2f1e-9a3e --namespace kube-system\\nName:           fluentd-cloud-logging-gke-kubia-default-pool-4ebc2f1e-9a3e\\nNamespace:      kube-system\\n...\\nVolumes:\\n  varlog:\\n    Type:       HostPath (bare host directory volume)\\n    Path:       /var/log\\n  varlibdockercontainers:\\n    Type:       HostPath (bare host directory volume)\\n    Path:       /var/lib/docker/containers\\nTIP\\nIf youâre using Minikube, try the kube-addon-manager-minikube pod.\\nAha! The pod uses two hostPath volumes to gain access to the nodeâs /var/log and\\nthe /var/lib/docker/containers directories. Youâd think you were lucky to find a pod\\nusing a hostPath volume on the first try, but not really (at least not on GKE). Check\\nthe other pods, and youâll see most use this type of volume either to access the nodeâs\\nlog files, kubeconfig (the Kubernetes config file), or the CA certificates.\\n If you inspect the other pods, youâll see none of them uses the hostPath volume\\nfor storing their own data. They all use it to get access to the nodeâs data. But as weâll\\nsee later in the chapter, hostPath volumes are often used for trying out persistent stor-\\nage in single-node clusters, such as the one created by Minikube. Read on to learn\\nabout the types of volumes you should use for storing persistent data properly even in\\na multi-node cluster.\\nListing 6.3\\n A pod using hostPath volumes to access the nodeâs logs\\n \\n',\n",

Never use them to persist data across pods. \\n6.4\\nUsing persistent storage\\nWhen an application running in a pod needs to persist data to disk and have that\\nsame data available even when the pod is rescheduled to another node, you canât use\\nany of the volume types weâve mentioned so far. Because this data needs to be accessi-\\nble from any cluster node, it must be stored on some type of network-attached stor-\\nage (NAS).\\n To learn about volumes that allow persisting data, youâll create a pod that will run\\nthe MongoDB document-oriented NoSQL database. Running a database pod without\\na volume or with a non-persistent volume doesnât make sense, except for testing\\npurposes, so youâll add an appropriate type of volume to the pod and mount it in the\\nMongoDB container. \\n6.4.1\\nUsing a GCE Persistent Disk in a pod volume\\nIf youâve been running these examples on Google Kubernetes Engine, which runs\\nyour cluster nodes on Google Compute Engine (GCE), youâll use a GCE Persistent\\nDisk as your underlying storage mechanism. \\n In the early versions, Kubernetes didnât provision the underlying storage automati-\\ncallyâyou had to do that manually. Automatic provisioning is now possible, and youâll\\nlearn about it later in the chapter, but first, youâll start by provisioning the storage\\nmanually. It will give you a chance to learn exactly whatâs going on underneath. \\nCREATING A GCE PERSISTENT DISK\\nYouâll start by creating the GCE persistent disk first. You need to create it in the same\\nzone as your Kubernetes cluster. If you donât remember what zone you created the\\ncluster in, you can see it by listing your Kubernetes clusters with the gcloud command\\nlike this:\\n$ gcloud container clusters list\\nNAME   ZONE            MASTER_VERSION  MASTER_IP       ...\\nkubia  europe-west1-b  1.2.5           104.155.84.137  ...\\nThis shows youâve created your cluster in zone europe-west1-b, so you need to create\\nthe GCE persistent disk in the same zone as well. You create the disk like this:\\n$ gcloud compute disks create --size=1GiB --zone=europe-west1-b mongodb\\nWARNING: You have selected a disk size of under [200GB]. This may result in \\npoor I/O performance.

Youâll use it again later in\\nthe chapter.\\n6.4.2\\nUsing other types of volumes with underlying persistent storage\\nThe reason you created the GCE Persistent Disk volume is because your Kubernetes\\ncluster runs on Google Kubernetes Engine. When you run your cluster elsewhere, you\\nshould use other types of volumes, depending on the underlying infrastructure.\\n If your Kubernetes cluster is running on Amazonâs AWS EC2, for example, you can\\nuse an awsElasticBlockStore volume to provide persistent storage for your pods. If\\nyour cluster runs on Microsoft Azure, you can use the azureFile or the azureDisk\\nvolume. We wonât go into detail on how to do that here, but itâs virtually the same as in\\nthe previous example. First, you need to create the actual underlying storage, and\\nthen set the appropriate properties in the volume definition.\\nUSING AN AWS ELASTIC BLOCK STORE VOLUME\\nFor example, to use an AWS elastic block store instead of the GCE Persistent Disk,\\nyouâd only need to change the volume definition as shown in the following listing (see\\nthose lines printed in bold).\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: mongodb \\nspec:\\n  volumes:                       \\n  - name: mongodb-data           \\n    awsElasticBlockStore:          \\nListing 6.6\\nRetrieving MongoDBâs persisted data in a new pod\\nListing 6.7\\nA pod using an awsElasticBlockStore volume: mongodb-pod-aws.yaml\\nUsing awsElasticBlockStore \\ninstead of gcePersistentDisk\\n \\n',\n",

For example, to\\nmount a simple NFS share, you only need to specify the NFS server and the path\\nexported by the server, as shown in the following listing.\\n  volumes:                       \\n  - name: mongodb-data           \\n    nfs:                     \\n      server: 1.2.3.4         \\n      path: /some/path     \\nUSING OTHER STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES\\nOther supported options include iscsi for mounting an ISCSI disk resource, glusterfs\\nfor a GlusterFS mount, rbd for a RADOS Block Device, flexVolume, cinder, cephfs,\\nflocker, fc (Fibre Channel), and others. You donât need to know all of them if youâre\\nnot using them. Theyâre mentioned here to show you that Kubernetes supports a\\nbroad range of storage technologies and you can use whichever you prefer and are\\nused to.\\n To see details on what properties you need to set for each of these volume types,\\nyou can either turn to the Kubernetes API definitions in the Kubernetes API refer-\\nence or look up the information through kubectl explain, as shown in chapter 3. If\\nyouâre already familiar with a particular storage technology, using the explain com-\\nmand should allow you to easily figure out how to mount a volume of the proper type\\nand use it in your pods.\\n But does a developer need to know all this stuff? Should a developer, when creat-\\ning a pod, have to deal with infrastructure-related storage details, or should that be\\nleft to the cluster administrator? \\n Having a podâs volumes refer to the actual underlying infrastructure isnât what\\nKubernetes is about, is it? For example, for a developer to have to specify the host-\\nname of the NFS server feels wrong. And thatâs not even the worst thing about it. \\n Including this type of infrastructure-related information into a pod definition\\nmeans the pod definition is pretty much tied to a specific Kubernetes cluster. You\\ncanât use the same pod definition in another one. Thatâs why using volumes like this\\nisnât the best way to attach persistent storage to your pods.

For example, to create a NFS-backed volume, the developer has to know the actual\\nserver the NFS export is located on. This is against the basic idea of Kubernetes, which\\naims to hide the actual infrastructure from both the application and its developer, leav-\\ning them free from worrying about the specifics of the infrastructure and making apps\\nportable across a wide array of cloud providers and on-premises datacenters.\\n Ideally, a developer deploying their apps on Kubernetes should never have to\\nknow what kind of storage technology is used underneath, the same way they donât\\nhave to know what type of physical servers are being used to run their pods. Infrastruc-\\nture-related dealings should be the sole domain of the cluster administrator.\\n When a developer needs a certain amount of persistent storage for their applica-\\ntion, they can request it from Kubernetes, the same way they can request CPU, mem-\\nory, and other resources when creating a pod. The system administrator can configure\\nthe cluster so it can give the apps what they request.\\n6.5.1\\nIntroducing PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims\\nTo enable apps to request storage in a Kubernetes cluster without having to deal with\\ninfrastructure specifics, two new resources were introduced. They are Persistent-\\nVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims. The names may be a bit misleading, because as\\nyouâve seen in the previous few sections, even regular Kubernetes volumes can be\\nused to store persistent data. \\n Using a PersistentVolume inside a pod is a little more complex than using a regular\\npod volume, so letâs illustrate how pods, PersistentVolumeClaims, PersistentVolumes,\\nand the actual underlying storage relate to each other in figure 6.6.\\nPod\\nAdmin\\nVolume\\n1.

Delete the pod and the PersistentVolumeClaim:\\n$ kubectl delete pod mongodb\\npod \"mongodb\" deleted\\n$ kubectl delete pvc mongodb-pvc\\npersistentvolumeclaim \"mongodb-pvc\" deleted\\nWhat if you create the PersistentVolumeClaim again? Will it be bound to the Persistent-\\nVolume or not? After you create the claim, what does kubectl get pvc show?\\n$ kubectl get pvc\\nNAME           STATUS    VOLUME       CAPACITY   ACCESSMODES   AGE\\nmongodb-pvc    Pending                                         13s\\nThe claimâs status is shown as Pending. Interesting. When you created the claim ear-\\nlier, it was immediately bound to the PersistentVolume, so why wasnât it bound now?\\nMaybe listing the PersistentVolumes can shed more light on this:\\n$ kubectl get pv\\nNAME        CAPACITY  ACCESSMODES  STATUS    CLAIM               REASON AGE\\nmongodb-pv  1Gi       RWO,ROX      Released  default/mongodb-pvc        5m\\nThe STATUS column shows the PersistentVolume as Released, not Available like\\nbefore. Because youâve already used the volume, it may contain data and shouldnât be\\nbound to a completely new claim without giving the cluster admin a chance to clean it\\nup. Without this, a new pod using the same PersistentVolume could read the data\\nstored there by the previous pod, even if the claim and pod were created in a different\\nnamespace (and thus likely belong to a different cluster tenant).\\nRECLAIMING PERSISTENTVOLUMES MANUALLY\\nYou told Kubernetes you wanted your PersistentVolume to behave like this when you\\ncreated itâby setting its persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy to Retain. You wanted\\nKubernetes to retain the volume and its contents after itâs released from its claim. As\\nfar as Iâm aware, the only way to manually recycle the PersistentVolume to make it\\navailable again is to delete and recreate the PersistentVolume resource. As you do\\nthat, itâs your decision what to do with the files on the underlying storage: you can\\neither delete them or leave them alone so they can be reused by the next  pod.\\nRECLAIMING PERSISTENTVOLUMES AUTOMATICALLY\\nTwo other possible reclaim policies exist: Recycle and Delete. The first one deletes\\nthe volumeâs contents and makes the volume available to be claimed again. This way,\\nthe PersistentVolume can be reused multiple times by different PersistentVolume-\\nClaims and different pods, as you can see in figure 6.9.\\n The Delete policy, on the other hand, deletes the underlying storage.

But this still requires a cluster administrator to pro-\\nvision the actual storage up front. Luckily, Kubernetes can also perform this job\\nautomatically through dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes.\\n The cluster admin, instead of creating PersistentVolumes, can deploy a Persistent-\\nVolume provisioner and define one or more StorageClass objects to let users choose\\nwhat type of PersistentVolume they want. The users can refer to the StorageClass in\\ntheir PersistentVolumeClaims and the provisioner will take that into account when\\nprovisioning the persistent storage. \\nNOTE\\nSimilar to PersistentVolumes, StorageClass resources arenât namespaced.\\nKubernetes includes provisioners for the most popular cloud providers, so the admin-\\nistrator doesnât always need to deploy a provisioner.

The developer then decides which one is most appropriate for\\neach claim they create. \\n The nice thing about StorageClasses is the fact that claims refer to them by\\nname. The PVC definitions are therefore portable across different clusters, as long\\nas the StorageClass names are the same across all of them. To see this portability\\nyourself, you can try running the same example on Minikube, if youâve been using\\nGKE up to this point. As a cluster admin, youâll have to create a different storage\\nclass (but with the same name). The storage class defined in the storageclass-fast-\\nhostpath.yaml file is tailor-made for use in Minikube. Then, once you deploy the stor-\\nage class, you as a cluster user can deploy the exact same PVC manifest and the exact\\nsame pod manifest as before. This shows how the pods and PVCs are portable across\\ndifferent clusters.\\n6.6.3\\nDynamic provisioning without specifying a storage class\\nAs weâve progressed through this chapter, attaching persistent storage to pods has\\nbecome ever simpler. The sections in this chapter reflect how provisioning of storage\\nhas evolved from early Kubernetes versions to now. In this final section, weâll look at\\nthe latest and simplest way of attaching a PersistentVolume to a pod. \\nLISTING STORAGE CLASSES\\nWhen you created your custom storage class called fast, you didnât check if any exist-\\ning storage classes were already defined in your cluster. Why donât you do that now?\\nHere are the storage classes available in GKE:\\n$ kubectl get sc\\nNAME                 TYPE\\nfast                 kubernetes.io/gce-pd\\nstandard (default)   kubernetes.io/gce-pd\\nNOTE\\nWeâre using sc as shorthand for storageclass.\\nBeside the fast storage class, which you created yourself, a standard storage class\\nexists and is marked as default. Youâll learn what that means in a moment. Letâs list the\\nstorage classes available in Minikube, so we can compare:\\n$ kubectl get sc\\nNAME                 TYPE\\nfast                 k8s.io/minikube-hostpath\\nstandard (default)   k8s.io/minikube-hostpath\\nAgain, the fast storage class was created by you and a default standard storage class\\nexists here as well.

Then, as the list of configuration\\noptions grows, you can move the configuration into a config file. \\n Another way of passing configuration options to an application thatâs widely popu-\\nlar in containerized applications is through environment variables. Instead of having\\nthe app read a config file or command-line arguments, the app looks up the value of a\\ncertain environment variable. The official MySQL container image, for example, uses\\nan environment variable called MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD for setting the password for the\\nroot super-user account. \\n But why are environment variables so popular in containers? Using configuration\\nfiles inside Docker containers is a bit tricky, because youâd have to bake the config file\\ninto the container image itself or mount a volume containing the file into the con-\\ntainer. Obviously, baking files into the image is similar to hardcoding configuration\\ninto the source code of the application, because it requires you to rebuild the image\\nevery time you want to change the config. Plus, everyone with access to the image can\\nsee the config, including any information that should be kept secret, such as creden-\\ntials or encryption keys. Using a volume is better, but still requires you to make sure\\nthe file is written to the volume before the container is started. \\n If youâve read the previous chapter, you might think of using a gitRepo volume as\\na configuration source. Thatâs not a bad idea, because it allows you to keep the config\\nnicely versioned and enables you to easily rollback a config change if necessary. But a\\nsimpler way allows you to put the configuration data into a top-level Kubernetes\\nresource and store it and all the other resource definitions in the same Git repository\\nor in any other file-based storage. The Kubernetes resource for storing configuration\\ndata is called a ConfigMap. Weâll learn how to use it in this chapter.\\n Regardless if youâre using a ConfigMap to store configuration data or not, you can\\nconfigure your apps by\\n\\uf0a1Passing command-line arguments to containers\\n\\uf0a1Setting custom environment variables for each container\\n\\uf0a1Mounting configuration files into containers through a special type of volume\\nWeâll go over all these options in the next few sections, but before we start, letâs look\\nat config options from a security perspective. Though most configuration options\\ndonât contain any sensitive information, several can. These include credentials, pri-\\nvate encryption keys, and similar data that needs to be kept secure. This type of infor-\\nmation needs to be handled with special care, which is why Kubernetes offers\\nanother type of first-class object called a Secret. Weâll learn about it in the last part of\\nthis chapter.\\n7.2\\nPassing command-line arguments to containers\\nIn all the examples so far, youâve created containers that ran the default command\\ndefined in the container image, but Kubernetes allows overriding the command as\\npart of the podâs container definition when you want to run a different executable\\n \\n',\n",

Weâll look at how to do that now.\\n7.2.1\\nDefining the command and arguments in Docker\\nThe first thing I need to explain is that the whole command that gets executed in the\\ncontainer is composed of two parts: the command and the arguments. \\nUNDERSTANDING ENTRYPOINT AND CMD\\nIn a Dockerfile, two instructions define the two parts:\\n\\uf0a1\\nENTRYPOINT defines the executable invoked when the container is started.\\n\\uf0a1\\nCMD specifies the arguments that get passed to the ENTRYPOINT.\\nAlthough you can use the CMD instruction to specify the command you want to execute\\nwhen the image is run, the correct way is to do it through the ENTRYPOINT instruction\\nand to only specify the CMD if you want to define the default arguments. The image can\\nthen be run without specifying any arguments\\n$ docker run <image>\\nor with additional arguments, which override whateverâs set under CMD in the Dockerfile:\\n$ docker run <image> <arguments>\\nUNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHELL AND EXEC FORMS\\nBut thereâs more. Both instructions support two different forms:\\n\\uf0a1\\nshell formâFor example, ENTRYPOINT node app.js.\\n\\uf0a1\\nexec formâFor example, ENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"].\\nThe difference is whether the specified command is invoked inside a shell or not. \\n In the kubia image you created in chapter 2, you used the exec form of the ENTRY-\\nPOINT instruction: \\nENTRYPOINT [\"node\", \"app.js\"]\\nThis runs the node process directly (not inside a shell), as you can see by listing the\\nprocesses running inside the container:\\n$ docker exec 4675d ps x\\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\\n    1 ?

Although it would be use-\\nful to also define environment variables at the\\npod level and have them be inherited by its\\ncontainers, no such option currently exists.\\nNOTE\\nLike the containerâs command and\\narguments, the list of environment variables\\nalso cannot be updated after the pod is created.\\nUsing fortune:args \\ninstead of fortune:latest\\nThis argument makes the \\nscript generate a new fortune \\nevery two seconds.\\nPod\\nContainer A\\nEnvironment variables\\nFOO=BAR\\nABC=123\\nContainer B\\nEnvironment variables\\nFOO=FOOBAR\\nBAR=567\\nFigure 7.1\\nEnvironment variables can \\nbe set per container.\\n \\n',\n",

You could easily have written this YAML yourself (you wouldnât\\nneed to specify anything but the name in the metadata section, of course) and posted\\nit to the Kubernetes API with the well-known\\n$ kubectl create -f fortune-config.yaml\\nCREATING A CONFIGMAP ENTRY FROM THE CONTENTS OF A FILE\\nConfigMaps can also store coarse-grained config data, such as complete config files.\\nTo do this, the kubectl create configmap command also supports reading files from\\ndisk and storing them as individual entries in the ConfigMap:\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config-file.conf\\nWhen you run the previous command, kubectl looks for the file config-file.conf in\\nthe directory you run kubectl in. It will then store the contents of the file under the\\nkey config-file.conf in the ConfigMap (the filename is used as the map key), but\\nyou can also specify a key manually like this:\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=customkey=config-file.conf\\nThis command will store the fileâs contents under the key customkey. As with literals,\\nyou can add multiple files by using the --from-file argument multiple times. \\nCREATING A CONFIGMAP FROM FILES IN A DIRECTORY\\nInstead of importing each file individually, you can even import all files from a file\\ndirectory:\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=/path/to/dir\\nIn this case, kubectl will create an individual map entry for each file in the specified\\ndirectory, but only for files whose name is a valid ConfigMap key. \\nCOMBINING DIFFERENT OPTIONS\\nWhen creating ConfigMaps, you can use a combination of all the options mentioned\\nhere (note that these files arenât included in the bookâs code archiveâyou can create\\nthem yourself if youâd like to try out the command):\\n$ kubectl create configmap my-config  \\nâ¥  --from-file=foo.json                  \\nâ¥  --from-file=bar=foobar.conf              \\nâ¥  --from-file=config-opts/               \\nâ¥  --from-literal=some=thing    \\nHere, youâve created the ConfigMap from multiple sources: a whole directory, a file,\\nanother file (but stored under a custom key instead of using the filename as the key),\\nand a literal value. Figure 7.5 shows all these sources and the resulting ConfigMap.\\nA single file\\nA file stored under \\na custom key\\nA whole directory\\nA literal value\\n \\n',\n",

Luckily,\\nKubernetes version 1.6 provides a way to expose all entries of a ConfigMap as environ-\\nment variables. \\n Imagine having a ConfigMap with three keys called FOO, BAR, and FOO-BAR. You can\\nexpose them all as environment variables by using the envFrom attribute, instead of\\nenv the way you did in previous examples. The following listing shows an example.\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: some-image\\n    envFrom:                \\n    - prefix: CONFIG_             \\n      configMapRef:              \\n        name: my-config-map      \\n...\\nAs you can see, you can also specify a prefix for the environment variables (CONFIG_ in\\nthis case). This results in the following two environment variables being present inside\\nthe container: CONFIG_FOO and CONFIG_BAR. \\nNOTE\\nThe prefix is optional, so if you omit it the environment variables will\\nhave the same name as the keys. \\nDid you notice I said two variables, but earlier, I said the ConfigMap has three entries\\n(FOO, BAR, and FOO-BAR)? Why is there no environment variable for the FOO-BAR\\nConfigMap entry?\\n The reason is that CONFIG_FOO-BAR isnât a valid environment variable name\\nbecause it contains a dash. Kubernetes doesnât convert the keys in any way (it doesnât\\nconvert dashes to underscores, for example). If a ConfigMap key isnât in the proper\\nformat, it skips the entry (but it does record an event informing you it skipped it).\\n7.4.5\\nPassing a ConfigMap entry as a command-line argument\\nNow, letâs also look at how to pass values from a ConfigMap as arguments to the main\\nprocess running in the container. You canât reference ConfigMap entries directly in\\nthe pod.spec.containers.args field, but you can first initialize an environment vari-\\nable from the ConfigMap entry and then refer to the variable inside the arguments as\\nshown in figure 7.7.\\n Listing 7.11 shows an example of how to do this in the YAML.\\n \\nListing 7.10\\nPod with env vars from all entries of a ConfigMap\\nUsing envFrom instead of env\\nAll environment variables will \\nbe prefixed with CONFIG_.\\nReferencing the ConfigMap \\ncalled my-config-map\\n \\n',\n",

Youâll use a config file to configure the Nginx web server running inside the\\nfortune podâs web-server container. Letâs say you want your Nginx server to compress\\nresponses it sends to the client. To enable compression, the config file for Nginx\\nneeds to look like the following listing.\\nserver {\\n  listen              80;\\n  server_name         www.kubia-example.com;\\n  gzip on;                                       \\n  gzip_types text/plain application/xml;         \\n  location / {\\n    root   /usr/share/nginx/html;\\n    index  index.html index.htm;\\n  }\\n}\\nNow delete your existing fortune-config ConfigMap with kubectl delete config-\\nmap fortune-config, so that you can replace it with a new one, which will include the\\nNginx config file. Youâll create the ConfigMap from files stored on your local disk. \\n Create a new directory called configmap-files and store the Nginx config from the\\nprevious listing into configmap-files/my-nginx-config.conf. To make the ConfigMap\\nalso contain the sleep-interval entry, add a plain text file called sleep-interval to the\\nsame directory and store the number 25 in it (see figure 7.8).\\nNow create a ConfigMap from all the files in the directory like this:\\n$ kubectl create configmap fortune-config --from-file=configmap-files\\nconfigmap \"fortune-config\" created\\nListing 7.12\\nAn Nginx config with enabled gzip compression: my-nginx-config.conf\\nThis enables gzip compression \\nfor plain text and XML files.\\nconï¬gmap-ï¬les/\\nmy-nginx-conï¬g.conf\\nserver {\\nlisten 80;\\nserver_name www.kubia...\\n...\\n}\\nsleep-interval\\n25\\nFigure 7.8\\nThe contents of the \\nconfigmap-files directory and its files\\n \\n',\n",

If you run the pod from the previous listing, the\\n/etc/nginx/conf.d directory is kept nice and clean, because it only contains the\\ngzip.conf file and nothing else. \\nUNDERSTANDING THAT MOUNTING A DIRECTORY HIDES EXISTING FILES IN THAT DIRECTORY\\nThereâs one important thing to discuss at this point. In both this and in your previous\\nexample, you mounted the volume as a directory, which means youâve hidden any files\\nthat are stored in the /etc/nginx/conf.d directory in the container image itself. \\n This is generally what happens in Linux when you mount a filesystem into a non-\\nempty directory. The directory then only contains the files from the mounted filesys-\\ntem, whereas the original files in that directory are inaccessible for as long as the\\nfilesystem is mounted. \\n In your case, this has no terrible side effects, but imagine mounting a volume to\\nthe /etc directory, which usually contains many important files. This would most likely\\nbreak the whole container, because all of the original files that should be in the /etc\\ndirectory would no longer be there. If you need to add a file to a directory like /etc,\\nyou canât use this method at all.\\nMOUNTING INDIVIDUAL CONFIGMAP ENTRIES AS FILES WITHOUT HIDING OTHER FILES IN THE DIRECTORY\\nNaturally, youâre now wondering how to add individual files from a ConfigMap into\\nan existing directory without hiding existing files stored in it. An additional subPath\\nproperty on the volumeMount allows you to mount either a single file or a single direc-\\ntory from the volume instead of mounting the whole volume. Perhaps this is easier to\\nexplain visually (see figure 7.10).\\n Say you have a configMap volume containing a myconfig.conf file, which you want\\nto add to the /etc directory as someconfig.conf. You can use the subPath property to\\nmount it there without affecting any other files in that directory. The relevant part of\\nthe pod definition is shown in the following listing.\\nPod\\nContainer\\nFilesystem\\n/\\netc/\\nsomeconï¬g.conf\\nexistingï¬le1\\nexistingï¬le2\\nConï¬gMap: app-conï¬g\\nmyconï¬g.conf\\nContents\\nof the ï¬le\\nanother-ï¬le\\nContents\\nof the ï¬le\\nconï¬gMap\\nvolume\\nmyconï¬g.conf\\nanother-ï¬le\\nexistingï¬le1\\nand existingï¬le2\\narenât hidden.\\nOnly myconï¬g.conf is mounted\\ninto the container (yet under a\\ndifferent ï¬lename).\\nanother-ï¬le isnât\\nmounted into the\\ncontainer.\\nFigure 7.10\\nMounting a single file from a volume\\n \\n',\n",

Using a ConfigMap and exposing it through a volume brings the\\nability to update the configuration without having to recreate the pod or even restart\\nthe container. \\n When you update a ConfigMap, the files in all the volumes referencing it are\\nupdated. Itâs then up to the process to detect that theyâve been changed and reload\\nthem. But Kubernetes will most likely eventually also support sending a signal to the\\ncontainer after updating the files.\\nWARNING\\nBe aware that as Iâm writing this, it takes a surprisingly long time\\nfor the files to be updated after you update the ConfigMap (it can take up to\\none whole minute).\\nListing 7.17\\nA pod with a specific config map entry mounted into a specific file\\nListing 7.18\\nSetting file permissions: fortune-pod-configmap-volume-defaultMode.yaml \\nYouâre mounting into \\na file, not a directory.\\nInstead of mounting the whole \\nvolume, youâre only mounting \\nthe myconfig.conf entry.\\nThis sets the permissions \\nfor all files to -rw-rw------.\\n \\n',\n",

Youâll modify the Nginx config file\\nfrom your previous example and make Nginx use the new config without restarting\\nthe pod. Try switching gzip compression off by editing the fortune-config Config-\\nMap with kubectl edit:\\n$ kubectl edit configmap fortune-config\\nOnce your editor opens, change the gzip on line to gzip off, save the file, and then\\nclose the editor. The ConfigMap is then updated, and soon afterward, the actual file\\nin the volume is updated as well. You can confirm this by printing the contents of the\\nfile with kubectl exec:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server\\nâ¥  cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/my-nginx-config.conf\\nIf you donât see the update yet, wait a while and try again. It takes a while for the\\nfiles to get updated. Eventually, youâll see the change in the config file, but youâll\\nfind this has no effect on Nginx, because it doesnât watch the files and reload them\\nautomatically. \\nSIGNALING NGINX TO RELOAD THE CONFIG\\nNginx will continue to compress its responses until you tell it to reload its config files,\\nwhich you can do with the following command:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server -- nginx -s reload\\nNow, if you try hitting the server again with curl, you should see the response is no\\nlonger compressed (it no longer contains the Content-Encoding: gzip header).\\nYouâve effectively changed the appâs config without having to restart the container or\\nrecreate the pod. \\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE FILES ARE UPDATED ATOMICALLY\\nYou may wonder what happens if an app can detect config file changes on its own and\\nreloads them before Kubernetes has finished updating all the files in the configMap\\nvolume. Luckily, this canât happen, because all the files are updated atomically, which\\nmeans all updates occur at once. Kubernetes achieves this by using symbolic links. If\\nyou list all the files in the mounted configMap volume, youâll see something like the\\nfollowing listing.\\n$ kubectl exec -it fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server -- ls -lA \\nâ¥  /etc/nginx/conf.d\\ntotal 4\\ndrwxr-xr-x  ... 12:15 ..4984_09_04_12_15_06.865837643\\nListing 7.19\\nFiles in a mounted configMap volume\\n \\n',\n",

The ..data dir is also a symbolic link pointing to a direc-\\ntory called ..4984_09_04_something. When the ConfigMap is updated, Kubernetes\\ncreates a new directory like this, writes all the files to it, and then re-links the ..data\\nsymbolic link to the new directory, effectively changing all files at once.\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT FILES MOUNTED INTO EXISTING DIRECTORIES DONâT GET UPDATED\\nOne big caveat relates to updating ConfigMap-backed volumes. If youâve mounted a\\nsingle file in the container instead of the whole volume, the file will not be updated!\\nAt least, this is true at the time of writing this chapter. \\n For now, if you need to add an individual file and have it updated when you update\\nits source ConfigMap, one workaround is to mount the whole volume into a different\\ndirectory and then create a symbolic link pointing to the file in question. The sym-\\nlink can either be created in the container image itself, or you could create the\\nsymlink when the container starts.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF UPDATING A CONFIGMAP\\nOne of the most important features of containers is their immutability, which allows\\nus to be certain that no differences exist between multiple running containers created\\nfrom the same image, so is it wrong to bypass this immutability by modifying a Config-\\nMap used by running containers? \\n The main problem occurs when the app doesnât support reloading its configura-\\ntion. This results in different running instances being configured differentlyâthose\\npods that are created after the ConfigMap is changed will use the new config, whereas\\nthe old pods will still use the old one. And this isnât limited to new pods. If a podâs con-\\ntainer is restarted (for whatever reason), the new process will also see the new config.\\nTherefore, if the app doesnât reload its config automatically, modifying an existing\\nConfigMap (while pods are using it) may not be a good idea. \\n If the app does support reloading, modifying the ConfigMap usually isnât such a\\nbig deal, but you do need to be aware that because files in the ConfigMap volumes\\narenât updated synchronously across all running instances, the files in individual pods\\nmay be out of sync for up to a whole minute.\\n7.5\\nUsing Secrets to pass sensitive data to containers\\nAll the information youâve passed to your containers so far is regular, non-sensitive\\nconfiguration data that doesnât need to be kept secure. But as we mentioned at the\\nstart of the chapter, the config usually also includes sensitive information, such as cre-\\ndentials and private encryption keys, which need to be kept secure.\\n \\n',\n",

Secrets are much like ConfigMapsâtheyâre also maps that hold key-value\\npairs. They can be used the same way as a ConfigMap. You can\\n\\uf0a1Pass Secret entries to the container as environment variables\\n\\uf0a1Expose Secret entries as files in a volume\\nKubernetes helps keep your Secrets safe by making sure each Secret is only distributed\\nto the nodes that run the pods that need access to the Secret. Also, on the nodes\\nthemselves, Secrets are always stored in memory and never written to physical storage,\\nwhich would require wiping the disks after deleting the Secrets from them. \\n On the master node itself (more specifically in etcd), Secrets used to be stored in\\nunencrypted form, which meant the master node needs to be secured to keep the sensi-\\ntive data stored in Secrets secure. This didnât only include keeping the etcd storage\\nsecure, but also preventing unauthorized users from using the API server, because any-\\none who can create pods can mount the Secret into the pod and gain access to the sen-\\nsitive data through it. From Kubernetes version 1.7, etcd stores Secrets in encrypted\\nform, making the system much more secure. Because of this, itâs imperative you prop-\\nerly choose when to use a Secret or a ConfigMap. Choosing between them is simple:\\n\\uf0a1Use a ConfigMap to store non-sensitive, plain configuration data.\\n\\uf0a1Use a Secret to store any data that is sensitive in nature and needs to be kept\\nunder key. If a config file includes both sensitive and not-sensitive data, you\\nshould store the file in a Secret.\\nYou already used Secrets in chapter 5, when you created a Secret to hold the TLS certifi-\\ncate needed for the Ingress resource. Now youâll explore Secrets in more detail.\\n7.5.2\\nIntroducing the default token Secret\\nYouâll start learning about Secrets by examining a Secret thatâs mounted into every\\ncontainer you run. You may have noticed it when using kubectl describe on a pod.\\nThe commandâs output has always contained something like this:\\nVolumes:\\n  default-token-cfee9:\\n    Type:       Secret (a volume populated by a Secret)\\n    SecretName: default-token-cfee9\\nEvery pod has a secret volume attached to it automatically. The volume in the previ-\\nous kubectl describe output refers to a Secret called default-token-cfee9. Because\\nSecrets are resources, you can list them with kubectl get secrets and find the\\ndefault-token Secret in that list. Letâs see:\\n$ kubectl get secrets\\nNAME                  TYPE                                  DATA      AGE\\ndefault-token-cfee9   kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3         39d\\n \\n',\n",

Youâll improve your fortune-serving Nginx\\ncontainer by configuring it to also serve HTTPS traffic. For this, you need to create a\\ncertificate and a private key. The private key needs to be kept secure, so youâll put it\\nand the certificate into a Secret.\\n First, generate the certificate and private key files (do this on your local machine).\\nYou can also use the files in the bookâs code archive (the cert and key files are in the\\nfortune-https directory):\\n$ openssl genrsa -out https.key 2048\\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key https.key -out https.cert -days 3650 -subj \\n/CN=www.kubia-example.com\\nNow, to help better demonstrate a few things about Secrets, create an additional\\ndummy file called foo and make it contain the string bar. Youâll understand why you\\nneed to do this in a moment or two:\\n$ echo bar > foo\\nNow you can use kubectl create secret to create a Secret from the three files:\\n$ kubectl create secret generic fortune-https --from-file=https.key\\nâ¥  --from-file=https.cert --from-file=foo\\nsecret \"fortune-https\" created\\nThis isnât very different from creating ConfigMaps. In this case, youâre creating a\\ngeneric Secret called fortune-https and including two entries in it (https.key with\\nthe contents of the https.key file and likewise for the https.cert key/file).

The following listing shows the YAML of the Secret you created.\\n$ kubectl get secret fortune-https -o yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\ndata:\\n  foo: YmFyCg==\\n  https.cert: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJUSUZJQ0FURS0tLS0tCk1JSURCekNDQ...\\n  https.key: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0EgUFJJVkFURSBLRVktLS0tLQpNSUlFcE...\\nkind: Secret\\n...\\nNow compare this to the YAML of the ConfigMap you created earlier, which is shown\\nin the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get configmap fortune-config -o yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\ndata:\\n  my-nginx-config.conf: |\\n    server {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  sleep-interval: |\\n    25\\nkind: ConfigMap\\n...\\nNotice the difference? The contents of a Secretâs entries are shown as Base64-encoded\\nstrings, whereas those of a ConfigMap are shown in clear text. This initially made\\nworking with Secrets in YAML and JSON manifests a bit more painful, because you\\nhad to encode and decode them when setting and reading their entries. \\nUSING SECRETS FOR BINARY DATA\\nThe reason for using Base64 encoding is simple. A Secretâs entries can contain binary\\nvalues, not only plain-text. Base64 encoding allows you to include the binary data in\\nYAML or JSON, which are both plain-text formats. \\nTIP\\nYou can use Secrets even for non-sensitive binary data, but be aware that\\nthe maximum size of a Secret is limited to 1MB.\\nListing 7.21\\nA Secretâs YAML definition\\nListing 7.22\\nA ConfigMapâs YAML definition\\n \\n',\n",

It can only be\\nused to set values. When you retrieve the Secretâs YAML with kubectl get -o yaml, the\\nstringData field will not be shown. Instead, all entries you specified in the string-\\nData field (such as the foo entry in the previous example) will be shown under data\\nand will be Base64-encoded like all the other entries. \\nREADING A SECRETâS ENTRY IN A POD\\nWhen you expose the Secret to a container through a secret volume, the value of the\\nSecret entry is decoded and written to the file in its actual form (regardless if itâs plain\\ntext or binary). The same is also true when exposing the Secret entry through an envi-\\nronment variable. In both cases, the app doesnât need to decode it, but can read the\\nfileâs contents or look up the environment variable value and use it directly.\\n7.5.5\\nUsing the Secret in a pod\\nWith your fortune-https Secret containing both the cert and key files, all you need to\\ndo now is configure Nginx to use them. \\nMODIFYING THE FORTUNE-CONFIG CONFIGMAP TO ENABLE HTTPS\\nFor this, you need to modify the config file again by editing the ConfigMap:\\n$ kubectl edit configmap fortune-config\\nAfter the text editor opens, modify the part that defines the contents of the my-nginx-\\nconfig.conf entry so it looks like the following listing.\\n...\\ndata:\\n  my-nginx-config.conf: |\\n    server {\\n      listen              80;\\n      listen              443 ssl;\\n      server_name         www.kubia-example.com;\\nListing 7.23\\nAdding plain text entries to a Secret using the stringData field\\nListing 7.24\\nModifying the fortune-config ConfigMapâs data\\nThe stringData can be used \\nfor non-binary Secret data.\\nSee, âplain textâ is not Base64-encoded.\\n \\n',\n",

You can check the\\nserverâs certificate to see if it matches the one you generated earlier. This can also be\\ndone with curl by turning on verbose logging using the -v option, as shown in the fol-\\nlowing listing.\\n$ curl https://localhost:8443 -k -v\\n* About to connect() to localhost port 8443 (#0)\\n*   Trying ::1...\\n* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8443 (#0)\\n* Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb\\n* skipping SSL peer certificate verification\\n* SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384\\n* Server certificate:\\n*   subject: CN=www.kubia-example.com          \\n*   start date: aug 16 18:43:13 2016 GMT       \\n*   expire date: aug 14 18:43:13 2026 GMT      \\n*   common name: www.kubia-example.com         \\n*   issuer: CN=www.kubia-example.com           \\nUNDERSTANDING SECRET VOLUMES ARE STORED IN MEMORY\\nYou successfully delivered your certificate and private key to your container by mount-\\ning a secret volume in its directory tree at /etc/nginx/certs. The secret volume uses\\nan in-memory filesystem (tmpfs) for the Secret files. You can see this if you list mounts\\nin the container:\\n$ kubectl exec fortune-https -c web-server -- mount | grep certs\\ntmpfs on /etc/nginx/certs type tmpfs (ro,relatime) \\nBecause tmpfs is used, the sensitive data stored in the Secret is never written to disk,\\nwhere it could be compromised. \\nEXPOSING A SECRETâS ENTRIES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\\nInstead of using a volume, you could also have exposed individual entries from the\\nsecret as environment variables, the way you did with the sleep-interval entry from\\nthe ConfigMap. For example, if you wanted to expose the foo key from your Secret as\\nenvironment variable FOO_SECRET, youâd add the snippet from the following listing to\\nthe container definition.\\nListing 7.26\\nDisplaying the server certificate sent by Nginx\\nThe certificate \\nmatches the one you \\ncreated and stored \\nin the Secret.\\n \\n',\n",

Applications usually dump envi-\\nronment variables in error reports or even write them to the application log at startup,\\nwhich may unintentionally expose them. Additionally, child processes inherit all the\\nenvironment variables of the parent process, so if your app runs a third-party binary,\\nyou have no way of knowing what happens with your secret data. \\nTIP\\nThink twice before using environment variables to pass your Secrets to\\nyour container, because they may get exposed inadvertently. To be safe, always\\nuse secret volumes for exposing Secrets.\\n7.5.6\\nUnderstanding image pull Secrets\\nYouâve learned how to pass Secrets to your applications and use the data they contain.\\nBut sometimes Kubernetes itself requires you to pass credentials to itâfor example,\\nwhen youâd like to use images from a private container image registry. This is also\\ndone through Secrets.\\n Up to now all your container images have been stored on public image registries,\\nwhich donât require any special credentials to pull images from them. But most orga-\\nnizations donât want their images to be available to everyone and thus use a private\\nimage registry. When deploying a pod, whose container images reside in a private reg-\\nistry, Kubernetes needs to know the credentials required to pull the image. Letâs see\\nhow to do that.\\nUSING A PRIVATE IMAGE REPOSITORY ON DOCKER HUB\\nDocker Hub, in addition to public image repositories, also allows you to create private\\nrepositories. You can mark a repository as private by logging in at http:/\\n/hub.docker\\n.com with your web browser, finding the repository and checking a checkbox. \\n To run a pod, which uses an image from the private repository, you need to do\\ntwo things:\\n\\uf0a1Create a Secret holding the credentials for the Docker registry.\\n\\uf0a1Reference that Secret in the imagePullSecrets field of the pod manifest.\\nListing 7.27\\nExposing a Secretâs entry as an environment variable\\nThe variable should be set \\nfrom the entry of a Secret.\\nThe name of the Secret \\nholding the key\\nThe key of the Secret \\nto expose\\n \\n',\n",

But what about data that isnât known up until\\nthat pointâsuch as the podâs IP, the host nodeâs name, or even the podâs own name\\n(when the name is generated; for example, when the pod is created by a ReplicaSet\\nor similar controller)? And what about data thatâs already specified elsewhere, such\\nas a podâs labels and annotations? You donât want to repeat the same information in\\nmultiple places.\\n Both these problems are solved by the Kubernetes Downward API. It allows you to\\npass metadata about the pod and its environment through environment variables or\\nfiles (in a downwardAPI volume). Donât be confused by the name. The Downward API\\nisnât like a REST endpoint that your app needs to hit so it can get the data. Itâs a way of\\nhaving environment variables or files populated with values from the podâs specifica-\\ntion or status, as shown in figure 8.1.\\n8.1.1\\nUnderstanding the available metadata\\nThe Downward API enables you to expose the podâs own metadata to the processes\\nrunning inside that pod. Currently, it allows you to pass the following information to\\nyour containers:\\n\\uf0a1The podâs name\\n\\uf0a1The podâs IP address\\nContainer: main\\nEnvironment\\nvariables\\nAPI server\\nUsed to initialize environment\\nvariables and ï¬les in the\\ndownwardAPI volume\\nPod manifest\\n- Metadata\\n- Status\\nPod\\ndownwardAPI\\nvolume\\nApp process\\nFigure 8.1\\nThe Downward API exposes pod metadata through environment variables or files.\\n \\n',\n",

This also explains why labels and\\nannotations canât be exposed through environment variables. Because environment\\nvariable values canât be updated afterward, if the labels or annotations of a pod were\\nexposed through environment variables, thereâs no way to expose the new values after\\ntheyâre modified.\\nListing 8.4\\nFiles in the downwardAPI volume\\nListing 8.5\\nDisplaying labels and annotations in the downwardAPI volume\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '233\\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\\nREFERRING TO CONTAINER-LEVEL METADATA IN THE VOLUME SPECIFICATION\\nBefore we wrap up this section, we need to point out one thing. When exposing con-\\ntainer-level metadata, such as a containerâs resource limit or requests (done using\\nresourceFieldRef), you need to specify the name of the container whose resource\\nfield youâre referencing, as shown in the following listing.\\nspec:\\n  volumes:\\n  - name: downward                       \\n    downwardAPI:                         \\n      items:\\n      - path: \"containerCpuRequestMilliCores\"\\n        resourceFieldRef:\\n          containerName: main       \\n          resource: requests.cpu\\n          divisor: 1m\\nThe reason for this becomes obvious if you consider that volumes are defined at the\\npod level, not at the container level. When referring to a containerâs resource field\\ninside a volume specification, you need to explicitly specify the name of the container\\nyouâre referring to. This is true even for single-container pods. \\n Using volumes to expose a containerâs resource requests and/or limits is slightly\\nmore complicated than using environment variables, but the benefit is that it allows\\nyou to pass one containerâs resource fields to a different container if needed (but\\nboth containers need to be in the same pod). With environment variables, a container\\ncan only be passed its own resource limits and requests. \\nUNDERSTANDING WHEN TO USE THE DOWNWARD API\\nAs youâve seen, using the Downward API isnât complicated. It allows you to keep the\\napplication Kubernetes-agnostic. This is especially useful when youâre dealing with an\\nexisting application that expects certain data in environment variables. The Down-\\nward API allows you to expose the data to the application without having to rewrite\\nthe application or wrap it in a shell script, which collects the data and then exposes it\\nthrough environment variables.\\n But the metadata available through the Downward API is fairly limited. If you need\\nmore, youâll need to obtain it from the Kubernetes API server directly. Youâll learn\\nhow to do that next.\\n8.2\\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\\nWeâve seen how the Downward API provides a simple way to pass certain pod and con-\\ntainer metadata to the process running inside them. It only exposes the podâs own\\nmetadata and a subset of all of the podâs data. But sometimes your app will need to\\nknow more about other pods and even other resources defined in your cluster. The\\nDownward API doesnât help in those cases.\\nListing 8.6\\nReferring to container-level metadata in a downwardAPI volume\\nContainer name \\nmust be specified\\n \\n',\n",

But if youâre planning on\\ndeveloping apps that talk to the Kubernetes API, youâll want to know the API first. \\n To do that, you can try hitting the API server directly. You can get its URL by run-\\nning kubectl cluster-info:\\n$ kubectl cluster-info\\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443\\nBecause the server uses HTTPS and requires authentication, itâs not simple to talk to\\nit directly.

Youâll run a pod\\nthat does nothing (it runs the sleep command in its only container), and then run a\\nshell in the container with kubectl exec. Then youâll try to access the API server from\\nwithin that shell using curl.\\n Therefore, you need to use a container image that contains the curl binary. If you\\nsearch for such an image on, say, Docker Hub, youâll find the tutum/curl image, so\\nuse it (you can also use any other existing image containing the curl binary or you\\ncan build your own). The pod definition is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: curl\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: tutum/curl                \\n    command: [\"sleep\", \"9999999\"]    \\nAfter creating the pod, run kubectl exec to run a bash shell inside its container:\\n$ kubectl exec -it curl bash\\nroot@curl:/#\\nYouâre now ready to talk to the API server.\\nFINDING THE API SERVERâS ADDRESS\\nFirst, you need to find the IP and port of the Kubernetes API server. This is easy,\\nbecause a Service called kubernetes is automatically exposed in the default name-\\nspace and configured to point to the API server. You may remember seeing it every\\ntime you listed services with kubectl get svc:\\n$ kubectl get svc\\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\\nkubernetes   10.0.0.1     <none>        443/TCP   46d\\nAnd youâll remember from chapter 5 that environment variables are configured for\\neach service. You can get both the IP address and the port of the API server by looking\\nup the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT variables (inside\\nthe container):\\nroot@curl:/# env | grep KUBERNETES_SERVICE\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.1\\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443\\nListing 8.12\\nA pod for trying out communication with the API server: curl.yaml\\nUsing the tutum/curl image, \\nbecause you need curl \\navailable in the container\\nYouâre running the sleep \\ncommand with a long delay to \\nkeep your container running.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"240\\nCHAPTER 8\\nAccessing pod metadata and other resources from applications\\nYou may also remember that each service also gets a DNS entry, so you donât even\\nneed to look up the environment variables, but instead simply point curl to\\nhttps:/\\n/kubernetes. To be fair, if you donât know which port the service is available at,\\nyou also either need to look up the environment variables or perform a DNS SRV\\nrecord lookup to get the serviceâs actual port number. \\n The environment variables shown previously say that the API server is listening on\\nport 443, which is the default port for HTTPS, so try hitting the server through\\nHTTPS:\\nroot@curl:/# curl https://kubernetes\\ncurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\\n...\\nIf you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use\\n  the -k (or --insecure) option.\\nAlthough the simplest way to get around this is to use the proposed -k option (and\\nthis is what youâd normally use when playing with the API server manually), letâs look\\nat the longer (and correct) route. Instead of blindly trusting that the server youâre\\nconnecting to is the authentic API server, youâll verify its identity by having curl check\\nits certificate. \\nTIP\\nNever skip checking the serverâs certificate in an actual application.\\nDoing so could make your app expose its authentication token to an attacker\\nusing a man-in-the-middle attack.\\nVERIFYING THE SERVERâS IDENTITY\\nIn the previous chapter, while discussing Secrets, we looked at an automatically cre-\\nated Secret called default-token-xyz, which is mounted into each container at\\n/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/. Letâs see the contents of that Secret\\nagain, by listing files in that directory:\\nroot@curl:/# \\nls \\n/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nca.crt    namespace    token\\nThe Secret has three entries (and therefore three files in the Secret volume). Right\\nnow, weâll focus on the ca.crt file, which holds the certificate of the certificate author-\\nity (CA) used to sign the Kubernetes API serverâs certificate. To verify youâre talking to\\nthe API server, you need to check if the serverâs certificate is signed by the CA. curl\\nallows you to specify the CA certificate with the --cacert option, so try hitting the API\\nserver again:\\nroot@curl:/# curl --cacert /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount\\n             â¥ /ca.crt https://kubernetes\\nUnauthorized\\nNOTE\\nYou may see a longer error description than âUnauthorized.â\\n \\n\",\n",

As the Unauthorized response suggests, you still need\\nto take care of authentication. Youâll do that in a moment, but first letâs see how to\\nmake life easier by setting the CURL_CA_BUNDLE environment variable, so you donât\\nneed to specify --cacert every time you run curl:\\nroot@curl:/# export CURL_CA_BUNDLE=/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/\\n             â¥ serviceaccount/ca.crt\\nYou can now hit the API server without using --cacert:\\nroot@curl:/# curl https://kubernetes\\nUnauthorized\\nThis is much nicer now. Your client (curl) trusts the API server now, but the API\\nserver itself says youâre not authorized to access it, because it doesnât know who\\nyou are.\\nAUTHENTICATING WITH THE API SERVER\\nYou need to authenticate with the server, so it allows you to read and even update\\nand/or delete the API objects deployed in the cluster. To authenticate, you need an\\nauthentication token. Luckily, the token is provided through the default-token Secret\\nmentioned previously, and is stored in the token file in the secret volume. As the\\nSecretâs name suggests, thatâs the primary purpose of the Secret. \\n Youâre going to use the token to access the API server.

The API server recognized the token as authentic and returned a proper\\nresponse. You can now explore all the resources in your cluster, the way you did a few\\nsections ago. \\n For example, you could list all the pods in the same namespace. But first you need\\nto know what namespace the curl pod is running in.\\nGETTING THE NAMESPACE THE POD IS RUNNING IN\\nIn the first part of this chapter, you saw how to pass the namespace to the pod\\nthrough the Downward API. But if youâre paying attention, you probably noticed\\nyour secret volume also contains a file called namespace. It contains the name-\\nspace the pod is running in, so you can read the file instead of having to explicitly\\npass the namespace to your pod through an environment variable. Load the con-\\ntents of the file into the NS environment variable and then list all the pods, as shown\\nin the following listing.\\nroot@curl:/# NS=$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/\\n             â¥ serviceaccount/namespace)           \\nroot@curl:/# curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\"\\n             â¥ https://kubernetes/api/v1/namespaces/$NS/pods\\n{\\n  \"kind\": \"PodList\",\\n  \"apiVersion\": \"v1\",\\n  ...\\nAnd there you go. By using the three files in the mounted secret volume directory,\\nyou listed all the pods running in the same namespace as your pod. In the same man-\\nner, you could also retrieve other API objects and even update them by sending PUT or\\nPATCH instead of simple GET requests. \\nDisabling role-based access control (RBAC)\\nIf youâre using a Kubernetes cluster with RBAC enabled, the service account may not\\nbe authorized to access (parts of) the API server. Youâll learn about service accounts\\nand RBAC in chapter 12. For now, the simplest way to allow you to query the API\\nserver is to work around RBAC by running the following command:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding permissive-binding \\\\\\n  --clusterrole=cluster-admin \\\\\\n  --group=system:serviceaccounts\\nThis gives all service accounts (we could also say all pods) cluster-admin privileges,\\nallowing them to do whatever they want. Obviously, doing this is dangerous and\\nshould never be done on production clusters. For test purposes, itâs fine.\\nListing 8.14\\nListing pods in the podâs own namespace\\n \\n',\n",

You ran\\nthe command on your local machine to make it easier to access the API server. Instead\\nof sending requests to the API server directly, you sent them to the proxy and let it\\ntake care of authentication, encryption, and server verification. The same method can\\nbe used inside your pods, as well.\\nINTRODUCING THE AMBASSADOR CONTAINER PATTERN\\nImagine having an application that (among other things) needs to query the API\\nserver. Instead of it talking to the API server directly, as you did in the previous sec-\\ntion, you can run kubectl proxy in an ambassador container alongside the main con-\\ntainer and communicate with the API server through it. \\n Instead of talking to the API server directly, the app in the main container can con-\\nnect to the ambassador through HTTP (instead of HTTPS) and let the ambassador\\nproxy handle the HTTPS connection to the API server, taking care of security trans-\\nparently (see figure 8.6). It does this by using the files from the default tokenâs secret\\nvolume.\\nBecause all containers in a pod share the same loopback network interface, your app\\ncan access the proxy through a port on localhost.\\nRUNNING THE CURL POD WITH AN ADDITIONAL AMBASSADOR CONTAINER\\nTo see the ambassador container pattern in action, youâll create a new pod like the\\ncurl pod you created earlier, but this time, instead of running a single container in\\nthe pod, youâll run an additional ambassador container based on a general-purpose\\nkubectl-proxy container image Iâve created and pushed to Docker Hub. Youâll find\\nthe Dockerfile for the image in the code archive (in /Chapter08/kubectl-proxy/) if\\nyou want to build it yourself.\\n The podâs manifest is shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: curl-with-ambassador\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\nListing 8.15\\nA pod with an ambassador container: curl-with-ambassador.yaml\\nContainer:\\nmain\\nContainer:\\nambassador\\nHTTP\\nHTTPS\\nAPI server\\nPod\\nFigure 8.6\\nUsing an ambassador to connect to the API server\\n \\n',\n",

The output printed by curl is the same response you saw earlier, but this time\\nyou didnât need to deal with authentication tokens and server certificates. \\n To get a clear picture of what exactly happened, refer to figure 8.7. curl sent the\\nplain HTTP request (without any authentication headers) to the proxy running inside\\nthe ambassador container, and then the proxy sent an HTTPS request to the API\\nserver, handling the client authentication by sending the token and checking the\\nserverâs identity by validating its certificate.\\n This is a great example of how an ambassador container can be used to hide the\\ncomplexities of connecting to an external service and simplify the app running in\\nthe main container. The ambassador container is reusable across many different apps,\\nregardless of what language the main app is written in. The downside is that an addi-\\ntional process is running and consuming additional resources.\\nListing 8.16\\nAccessing the API server through the ambassador container\\nThe ambassador container, \\nrunning the kubectl-proxy image\\n \\n',\n",

The Kuber-\\nnetes API server exposes Swagger API definitions at /swaggerapi and OpenAPI spec at\\n/swagger.json. \\n To find out more about the Swagger framework, visit the website at http:/\\n/swagger.io.\\nEXPLORING THE API WITH SWAGGER UI\\nEarlier in the chapter I said Iâd point you to a better way of exploring the REST API\\ninstead of hitting the REST endpoints with curl. Swagger, which I mentioned in the\\nprevious section, is not just a tool for specifying an API, but also provides a web UI for\\nexploring REST APIs if they expose the Swagger API definitions. The better way of\\nexploring REST APIs is through this UI.\\n Kubernetes not only exposes the Swagger API, but it also has Swagger UI inte-\\ngrated into the API server, though itâs not enabled by default. You can enable it by\\nrunning the API server with the --enable-swagger-ui=true option.\\nTIP\\nIf youâre using Minikube, you can enable Swagger UI when starting the\\ncluster: minikube start --extra-config=apiserver.Features.Enable-\\nSwaggerUI=true\\nAfter you enable the UI, you can open it in your browser by pointing it to:\\nhttp(s)://<api server>:<port>/swagger-ui\\nI urge you to give Swagger UI a try. It not only allows you to browse the Kubernetes\\nAPI, but also interact with it (you can POST JSON resource manifests, PATCH resources,\\nor DELETE them, for example). \\n \\n',\n",

If\\nyouâre not completely sure what that means, keep readingâitâs not as complicated as\\nit sounds.\\n9.1\\nUpdating applications running in pods\\nLetâs start off with a simple example. Imagine having a set of pod instances providing a\\nservice to other pods and/or external clients. After reading this book up to this point,\\nyou likely recognize that these pods are backed by a ReplicationController or a\\nReplicaSet. A Service also exists through which clients (apps running in other pods or\\nexternal clients) access the pods. This is how a basic application looks in Kubernetes\\n(shown in figure 9.1).\\nInitially, the pods run the first version of your applicationâletâs suppose its image is\\ntagged as v1. You then develop a newer version of the app and push it to an image\\nrepository as a new image, tagged as v2. Youâd next like to replace all the pods with\\nthis new version. Because you canât change an existing podâs image after the pod is\\ncreated, you need to remove the old pods and replace them with new ones running\\nthe new image. \\n You have two ways of updating all those pods. You can do one of the following:\\n\\uf0a1Delete all existing pods first and then start the new ones.\\n\\uf0a1Start new ones and, once theyâre up, delete the old ones. You can do this either\\nby adding all the new pods and then deleting all the old ones at once, or\\nsequentially, by adding new pods and removing old ones gradually.\\nBoth these strategies have their benefits and drawbacks. The first option would lead to\\na short period of time when your application is unavailable. The second option\\nrequires your app to handle running two versions of the app at the same time. If your\\napp stores data in a data store, the new version shouldnât modify the data schema or\\nthe data in such a way that breaks the previous version.\\nReplicationController\\nor ReplicaSet\\nClients\\nService\\nPod\\nPod\\nPod\\nFigure 9.1\\nThe basic outline of an \\napplication running in Kubernetes\\n \\n',\n",

First, letâs look at\\nhow to do this manually; then, once you know whatâs involved in the process, youâll\\nlearn how to have Kubernetes perform the update automatically.\\n9.1.1\\nDeleting old pods and replacing them with new ones\\nYou already know how to get a ReplicationController to replace all its pod instances\\nwith pods running a new version. You probably remember the pod template of a\\nReplicationController can be updated at any time. When the ReplicationController\\ncreates new instances, it uses the updated pod template to create them.\\n If you have a ReplicationController managing a set of v1 pods, you can easily\\nreplace them by modifying the pod template so it refers to version v2 of the image and\\nthen deleting the old pod instances. The ReplicationController will notice that no\\npods match its label selector and it will spin up new instances. The whole process is\\nshown in figure 9.2.\\nThis is the simplest way to update a set of pods, if you can accept the short downtime\\nbetween the time the old pods are deleted and new ones are started.\\n9.1.2\\nSpinning up new pods and then deleting the old ones\\nIf you donât want to see any downtime and your app supports running multiple ver-\\nsions at once, you can turn the process around and first spin up all the new pods and\\nPod template\\nchanged\\nv pods deleted\\n1\\nmanually\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nReplicationController\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nPod: v1\\nService\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v2\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v1\\nPod: v1\\nReplicationController\\nService\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod: v1\\nPod\\ntemplate: v2\\nShort period of\\ndowntime here\\nv2 pods created by\\nReplicationController\\nFigure 9.2\\nUpdating pods by changing a ReplicationControllerâs pod template and deleting old Pods\\n \\n',\n",

This will require more hardware resources, because\\nyouâll have double the number of pods running at the same time for a short while. \\n This is a slightly more complex method compared to the previous one, but you\\nshould be able to do it by combining what youâve learned about ReplicationControl-\\nlers and Services so far.\\nSWITCHING FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW VERSION AT ONCE\\nPods are usually fronted by a Service. Itâs possible to have the Service front only the\\ninitial version of the pods while you bring up the pods running the new version. Then,\\nonce all the new pods are up, you can change the Serviceâs label selector and have the\\nService switch over to the new pods, as shown in figure 9.3. This is called a blue-green\\ndeployment. After switching over, and once youâre sure the new version functions cor-\\nrectly, youâre free to delete the old pods by deleting the old ReplicationController.\\nNOTE\\nYou can change a Serviceâs pod selector with the kubectl set selec-\\ntor command.\\nPERFORMING A ROLLING UPDATE\\nInstead of bringing up all the new pods and deleting the old pods at once, you can\\nalso perform a rolling update, which replaces pods step by step. You do this by slowly\\nscaling down the previous ReplicationController and scaling up the new one. In this\\ncase, youâll want the Serviceâs pod selector to include both the old and the new pods,\\nso it directs requests toward both sets of pods. See figure 9.4.\\n Doing a rolling update manually is laborious and error-prone. Depending on the\\nnumber of replicas, youâd need to run a dozen or more commands in the proper\\norder to perform the update process. Luckily, Kubernetes allows you to perform the\\nrolling update with a single command.

Using kubectl to perform the update makes the process\\nmuch easier, but, as youâll see later, this is now an outdated way of updating apps. Nev-\\nertheless, weâll walk through this option first, because it was historically the first way of\\ndoing an automatic rolling update, and also allows us to discuss the process without\\nintroducing too many additional concepts. \\n9.2.1\\nRunning the initial version of the app\\nObviously, before you can update an app, you need to have an app deployed. Youâre\\ngoing to use a slightly modified version of the kubia NodeJS app you created in chap-\\nter 2 as your initial version. In case you donât remember what it does, itâs a simple web-\\napp that returns the podâs hostname in the HTTP response. \\nCREATING THE V1 APP\\nYouâll change the app so it also returns its version number in the response, which will\\nallow you to distinguish between the different versions youâre about to build.

If youâre modifying the latest tag,\\nthatâs not a problem, but when youâre tagging an image with a different tag (for exam-\\nple, tag v1 instead of latest), once the image is pulled by a worker node, the image\\nwill be stored on the node and not pulled again when a new pod using the same\\nimage is run (at least thatâs the default policy for pulling images).\\nThat means any changes you make to the image wonât be picked up if you push them\\nto the same tag. If a new pod is scheduled to the same node, the Kubelet will run the\\nold version of the image. On the other hand, nodes that havenât run the old version\\nwill pull and run the new image, so you might end up with two different versions of\\nthe pod running. To make sure this doesnât happen, you need to set the containerâs\\nimagePullPolicy property to Always. \\nYou need to be aware that the default imagePullPolicy depends on the image tag.\\nIf a container refers to the latest tag (either explicitly or by not specifying the tag at\\nall), imagePullPolicy defaults to Always, but if the container refers to any other\\ntag, the policy defaults to IfNotPresent. \\nWhen using a tag other than latest, you need to set the imagePullPolicy properly\\nif you make changes to an image without changing the tag. Or better yet, make sure\\nyou always push changes to an image under a new tag.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '258\\nCHAPTER 9\\nDeployments: updating applications declaratively\\nUNDERSTANDING THE STEPS PERFORMED BY KUBECTL BEFORE THE ROLLING UPDATE COMMENCES\\nkubectl created this ReplicationController by copying the kubia-v1 controller and\\nchanging the image in its pod template. If you look closely at the controllerâs label\\nselector, youâll notice it has been modified, too. It includes not only a simple\\napp=kubia label, but also an additional deployment label which the pods must have in\\norder to be managed by this ReplicationController.\\n You probably know this already, but this is necessary to avoid having both the new\\nand the old ReplicationControllers operating on the same set of pods. But even if pods\\ncreated by the new controller have the additional deployment label in addition to the\\napp=kubia label, doesnât this mean theyâll be selected by the first ReplicationControl-\\nlerâs selector, because itâs set to app=kubia? \\n Yes, thatâs exactly what would happen, but thereâs a catch. The rolling-update pro-\\ncess has modified the selector of the first ReplicationController, as well:\\n$ kubectl describe rc kubia-v1\\nName:       kubia-v1\\nNamespace:  default\\nImage(s):   luksa/kubia:v1\\nSelector:   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd307978b502a5b975ed4045ae4964-orig \\nOkay, but doesnât this mean the first controller now sees zero pods matching its selec-\\ntor, because the three pods previously created by it contain only the app=kubia label?\\nNo, because kubectl had also modified the labels of the live pods just before modify-\\ning the ReplicationControllerâs selector:\\n$ kubectl get po --show-labels\\nNAME            READY  STATUS   RESTARTS  AGE  LABELS\\nkubia-v1-m33mv  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nkubia-v1-nmzw9  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nkubia-v1-cdtey  1/1    Running  0         2m   app=kubia,deployment=3ddd...\\nIf this is getting too complicated, examine figure 9.6, which shows the pods, their\\nlabels, and the two ReplicationControllers, along with their pod selectors.\\nReplicationController: kubia-v1\\nReplicas: 3\\nSelector: app=kubia,\\ndeployment=3dddâ¦\\nReplicationController: kubia-v2\\nReplicas: 0\\nSelector: app=kubia,\\ndeployment=757d...\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\ndeployment: 3ddd...\\napp: kubia\\nPod: v1\\nFigure 9.6\\nDetailed state of the old and new ReplicationControllers and pods at the start of a rolling \\nupdate\\n \\n',\n",

Well, in your case, the update went smoothly, but what if you\\nlost network connectivity while kubectl was performing the update? The update pro-\\ncess would be interrupted mid-way. Pods and ReplicationControllers would end up in\\nan intermediate state.\\n Another reason why performing an update like this isnât as good as it could be is\\nbecause itâs imperative. Throughout this book, Iâve stressed how Kubernetes is about\\nyou telling it the desired state of the system and having Kubernetes achieve that\\nstate on its own, by figuring out the best way to do it. This is how pods are deployed\\nand how pods are scaled up and down. You never tell Kubernetes to add an addi-\\ntional pod or remove an excess oneâyou change the number of desired replicas\\nand thatâs it.\\n Similarly, you will also want to change the desired image tag in your pod defini-\\ntions and have Kubernetes replace the pods with new ones running the new image.\\nThis is exactly what drove the introduction of a new resource called a Deployment,\\nwhich is now the preferred way of deploying applications in Kubernetes. \\n9.3\\nUsing Deployments for updating apps declaratively\\nA Deployment is a higher-level resource meant for deploying applications and\\nupdating them declaratively, instead of doing it through a ReplicationController or\\na ReplicaSet, which are both considered lower-level concepts.\\n When you create a Deployment, a ReplicaSet resource is created underneath\\n(eventually more of them). As you may remember from chapter 4, ReplicaSets are a\\nnew generation of ReplicationControllers, and should be used instead of them. Replica-\\nSets replicate and manage pods, as well. When using a Deployment, the actual pods\\nare created and managed by the Deploymentâs ReplicaSets, not by the Deployment\\ndirectly (the relationship is shown in figure 9.8).\\nYou might wonder why youâd want to complicate things by introducing another object\\non top of a ReplicationController or ReplicaSet, when theyâre what suffices to keep a set\\nof pod instances running. As the rolling update example in section 9.2 demonstrates,\\nwhen updating the app, you need to introduce an additional ReplicationController and\\nPods\\nReplicaSet\\nDeployment\\nFigure 9.8\\nA Deployment is backed \\nby a ReplicaSet, which supervises the \\ndeploymentâs pods.\\n \\n',\n",

You need something coordinating this dance. A Deployment resource\\ntakes care of that (itâs not the Deployment resource itself, but the controller process\\nrunning in the Kubernetes control plane that does that; but weâll get to that in chap-\\nter 11).\\n Using a Deployment instead of the lower-level constructs makes updating an app\\nmuch easier, because youâre defining the desired state through the single Deployment\\nresource and letting Kubernetes take care of the rest, as youâll see in the next few pages.\\n9.3.1\\nCreating a Deployment\\nCreating a Deployment isnât that different from creating a ReplicationController. A\\nDeployment is also composed of a label selector, a desired replica count, and a pod\\ntemplate. In addition to that, it also contains a field, which specifies a deployment\\nstrategy that defines how an update should be performed when the Deployment\\nresource is modified.  \\nCREATING A DEPLOYMENT MANIFEST\\nLetâs see how to use the kubia-v1 ReplicationController example from earlier in this\\nchapter and modify it so it describes a Deployment instead of a ReplicationController.\\nAs youâll see, this requires only three trivial changes. The following listing shows the\\nmodified YAML.\\napiVersion: apps/v1beta1          \\nkind: Deployment                  \\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia          \\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3\\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      name: kubia\\n      labels:\\n        app: kubia\\n    spec:\\n      containers:\\n      - image: luksa/kubia:v1\\n        name: nodejs\\nNOTE\\nYouâll find an older version of the Deployment resource in extensions/\\nv1beta1, and a newer one in apps/v1beta2 with different required fields and\\ndifferent defaults. Be aware that kubectl explain shows the older version.\\nBecause the ReplicationController from before was managing a specific version of the\\npods, you called it kubia-v1. A Deployment, on the other hand, is above that version\\nstuff. At a given point in time, the Deployment can have multiple pod versions run-\\nning under its wing, so its name shouldnât reference the app version.\\nListing 9.7\\nA Deployment definition: kubia-deployment-v1.yaml\\nDeployments are in the apps \\nAPI group, version v1beta1.\\nYouâve changed the kind \\nfrom ReplicationController \\nto Deployment.\\nThereâs no need to include \\nthe version in the name of \\nthe Deployment.\\n \\n',\n",

You can use the\\n--all switch to delete all those ReplicationControllers like this:\\n$ kubectl delete rc --all\\nYouâre now ready to create the Deployment: \\n$ kubectl create -f kubia-deployment-v1.yaml --record\\ndeployment \"kubia\" created\\nTIP\\nBe sure to include the --record command-line option when creating it.\\nThis records the command in the revision history, which will be useful later.\\nDISPLAYING THE STATUS OF THE DEPLOYMENT ROLLOUT\\nYou can use the usual kubectl get deployment and the kubectl describe deployment\\ncommands to see details of the Deployment, but let me point you to an additional\\ncommand, which is made specifically for checking a Deploymentâs status:\\n$ kubectl rollout status deployment kubia\\ndeployment kubia successfully rolled out\\nAccording to this, the Deployment has been successfully rolled out, so you should see\\nthe three pod replicas up and running. Letâs see:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-1506449474-otnnh   1/1       Running   0          14s\\nkubia-1506449474-vmn7s   1/1       Running   0          14s\\nkubia-1506449474-xis6m   1/1       Running   0          14s\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW DEPLOYMENTS CREATE REPLICASETS, WHICH THEN CREATE THE PODS\\nTake note of the names of these pods. Earlier, when you used a ReplicationController\\nto create pods, their names were composed of the name of the controller plus a ran-\\ndomly generated string (for example, kubia-v1-m33mv). The three pods created by\\nthe Deployment include an additional numeric value in the middle of their names.\\nWhat is that exactly?\\n The number corresponds to the hashed value of the pod template in the Deploy-\\nment and the ReplicaSet managing these pods. As we said earlier, a Deployment\\ndoesnât manage pods directly. Instead, it creates ReplicaSets and leaves the managing\\nto them, so letâs look at the ReplicaSet created by your Deployment:\\n$ kubectl get replicasets\\nNAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia-1506449474   3         3         10s\\nThe ReplicaSetâs name also contains the hash value of its pod template. As youâll see\\nlater, a Deployment creates multiple ReplicaSetsâone for each version of the pod\\n \\n',\n",

Using the hash value of the pod template like this allows the Deployment\\nto always use the same (possibly existing) ReplicaSet for a given version of the pod\\ntemplate.\\nACCESSING THE PODS THROUGH THE SERVICE\\nWith the three replicas created by this ReplicaSet now running, you can use the Ser-\\nvice you created a while ago to access them, because you made the new podsâ labels\\nmatch the Serviceâs label selector. \\n Up until this point, you probably havenât seen a good-enough reason why you should\\nuse Deployments over ReplicationControllers. Luckily, creating a Deployment also hasnât\\nbeen any harder than creating a ReplicationController. Now, youâll start doing things\\nwith this Deployment, which will make it clear why Deployments are superior. This will\\nbecome clear in the next few moments, when you see how updating the app through\\na Deployment resource compares to updating it through a ReplicationController.\\n9.3.2\\nUpdating a Deployment\\nPreviously, when you ran your app using a ReplicationController, you had to explicitly\\ntell Kubernetes to perform the update by running kubectl rolling-update. You even\\nhad to specify the name for the new ReplicationController that should replace the old\\none. Kubernetes replaced all the original pods with new ones and deleted the original\\nReplicationController at the end of the process. During the process, you basically had\\nto stay around, keeping your terminal open and waiting for kubectl to finish the roll-\\ning update. \\n Now compare this to how youâre about to update a Deployment. The only thing\\nyou need to do is modify the pod template defined in the Deployment resource and\\nKubernetes will take all the steps necessary to get the actual system state to whatâs\\ndefined in the resource. Similar to scaling a ReplicationController or ReplicaSet up or\\ndown, all you need to do is reference a new image tag in the Deploymentâs pod tem-\\nplate and leave it to Kubernetes to transform your system so it matches the new\\ndesired state.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABLE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES\\nHow this new state should be achieved is governed by the deployment strategy config-\\nured on the Deployment itself. The default strategy is to perform a rolling update (the\\nstrategy is called RollingUpdate). The alternative is the Recreate strategy, which\\ndeletes all the old pods at once and then creates new ones, similar to modifying a\\nReplicationControllerâs pod template and then deleting all the pods (we talked about\\nthis in section 9.1.1).\\n The Recreate strategy causes all old pods to be deleted before the new ones are\\ncreated. Use this strategy when your application doesnât support running multiple ver-\\nsions in parallel and requires the old version to be stopped completely before the\\nnew one is started. This strategy does involve a short period of time when your app\\nbecomes completely unavailable.\\n \\n',\n",

You can do that by setting the minReadySeconds attribute on the\\nDeployment. Weâll explain what this attribute does by the end of this chapter.

Instead of editing the whole YAML of the Deployment object or\\nusing the patch command to change the image, youâll use the kubectl set image\\ncommand, which allows changing the image of any resource that contains a container\\n(ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and so on). Youâll use it to modify\\nyour Deployment like this:\\n$ kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2\\ndeployment \"kubia\" image updated\\nWhen you execute this command, youâre updating the kubia Deploymentâs pod tem-\\nplate so the image used in its nodejs container is changed to luksa/kubia:v2 (from\\n:v1).

This works much like the rolling update per-\\nformed by kubectl.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE AWESOMENESS OF DEPLOYMENTS\\nLetâs think about what has happened. By changing the pod template in your Deploy-\\nment resource, youâve updated your app to a newer versionâby changing a single\\nfield! \\n The controllers running as part of the Kubernetes control plane then performed\\nthe update. The process wasnât performed by the kubectl client, like it was when you\\nused kubectl rolling-update. I donât know about you, but I think thatâs simpler than\\nhaving to run a special command telling Kubernetes what to do and then waiting\\naround for the process to be completed.\\nNOTE\\nBe aware that if the pod template in the Deployment references a\\nConfigMap (or a Secret), modifying the ConfigMap will not trigger an\\nupdate. One way to trigger an update when you need to modify an appâs con-\\nfig is to create a new ConfigMap and modify the pod template so it references\\nthe new ConfigMap.\\nThe events that occurred below the Deploymentâs surface during the update are simi-\\nlar to what happened during the kubectl rolling-update. An additional ReplicaSet\\nwas created and it was then scaled up slowly, while the previous ReplicaSet was scaled\\ndown to zero (the initial and final states are shown in figure 9.10).\\nYou can still see the old ReplicaSet next to the new one if you list them:\\n$ kubectl get rs\\nNAME               DESIRED   CURRENT   AGE\\nkubia-1506449474   0         0         24m\\nkubia-1581357123   3         3         23m\\nPods: v1\\nReplicaSet: v1\\nReplicas: --\\nBefore\\nAfter\\nReplicaSet: v2\\nReplicas: ++\\nDeployment\\nPods: v2\\nReplicaSet: v1\\nReplicaSet: v2\\nDeployment\\nFigure 9.10\\nA Deployment at the start and end of a rolling update\\n \\n',\n",

As\\nyouâll see later, the history is stored in the underlying ReplicaSets. When a rollout\\ncompletes, the old ReplicaSet isnât deleted, and this enables rolling back to any revi-\\nsion, not only the previous one. The revision history can be displayed with the\\nkubectl rollout history command:\\n$ kubectl rollout history deployment kubia\\ndeployments \"kubia\":\\nREVISION    CHANGE-CAUSE\\n2           kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2\\n3           kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v3\\nRemember the --record command-line option you used when creating the Deploy-\\nment? Without it, the CHANGE-CAUSE column in the revision history would be empty,\\nmaking it much harder to figure out whatâs behind each revision.\\nROLLING BACK TO A SPECIFIC DEPLOYMENT REVISION\\nYou can roll back to a specific revision by specifying the revision in the undo com-\\nmand. For example, if you want to roll back to the first version, youâd execute the fol-\\nlowing command:\\n$ kubectl rollout undo deployment kubia --to-revision=1\\nRemember the inactive ReplicaSet left over when you modified the Deployment the\\nfirst time? The ReplicaSet represents the first revision of your Deployment. All Replica-\\nSets created by a Deployment represent the complete revision history, as shown in fig-\\nure 9.11. Each ReplicaSet stores the complete information of the Deployment at that\\nspecific revision, so you shouldnât delete it manually. If you do, youâll lose that specific\\nrevision from the Deploymentâs history, preventing you from rolling back to it.\\nBut having old ReplicaSets cluttering your ReplicaSet list is not ideal, so the length of\\nthe revision history is limited by the revisionHistoryLimit property on the Deploy-\\nment resource. It defaults to two, so normally only the current and the previous revision\\nare shown in the history (and only the current and the previous ReplicaSet are pre-\\nserved). Older ReplicaSets are deleted automatically. \\nDeployment\\nv1 ReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nPods: v1\\nReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nReplicaSet\\nRevision 2\\nRevision 4\\nRevision 3\\nRevision 1\\nRevision history\\nCurrent revision\\nFigure 9.11\\nA Deploymentâs ReplicaSets also act as its revision history.\\n \\n',\n",

The way new pods are created and\\nold ones are deleted is configurable through two additional properties of the rolling\\nupdate strategy. \\nINTRODUCING THE MAXSURGE AND MAXUNAVAILABLE PROPERTIES OF THE ROLLING UPDATE STRATEGY\\nTwo properties affect how many pods are replaced at once during a Deploymentâs roll-\\ning update.

If the desired replica count is \\nset to four, there will never be more than five pod instances running at the same \\ntime during an update. When converting a percentage to an absolute number, \\nthe number is rounded up. Instead of a percentage, the value can also be an \\nabsolute value (for example, one or two additional pods can be allowed).\\nmaxUnavailable\\nDetermines how many pod instances can be unavailable relative to the desired \\nreplica count during the update. It also defaults to 25%, so the number of avail-\\nable pod instances must never fall below 75% of the desired replica count. Here, \\nwhen converting a percentage to an absolute number, the number is rounded \\ndown. If the desired replica count is set to four and the percentage is 25%, only \\none pod can be unavailable.

Thatâs why the rollout process immediately\\ndeletes one pod and creates two new ones. This ensures two pods are available and\\nthat the maximum number of pods isnât exceeded (the maximum is four in this\\ncaseâthree plus one from maxSurge). As soon as the two new pods are available, the\\ntwo remaining old pods are deleted.\\n This is a bit hard to grasp, especially since the maxUnavailable property leads you\\nto believe that thatâs the maximum number of unavailable pods that are allowed. If\\nyou look at the previous figure closely, youâll see two unavailable pods in the second\\ncolumn even though maxUnavailable is set to 1. \\n Itâs important to keep in mind that maxUnavailable is relative to the desired\\nreplica count. If the replica count is set to three and maxUnavailable is set to one,\\nthat means that the update process must always keep at least two (3 minus 1) pods\\navailable, while the number of pods that arenât available can exceed one.\\n9.3.5\\nPausing the rollout process\\nAfter the bad experience with version 3 of your app, imagine youâve now fixed the bug\\nand pushed version 4 of your image. Youâre a little apprehensive about rolling it out\\nacross all your pods the way you did before. What you want is to run a single v4 pod\\nnext to your existing v2 pods and see how it behaves with only a fraction of all your\\nusers. Then, once youâre sure everythingâs okay, you can replace all the old pods with\\nnew ones. \\n You could achieve this by running an additional pod either directly or through an\\nadditional Deployment, ReplicationController, or ReplicaSet, but you do have another\\noption available on the Deployment itself. A Deployment can also be paused during\\nthe rollout process. This allows you to verify that everything is fine with the new ver-\\nsion before proceeding with the rest of the rollout.\\nPAUSING THE ROLLOUT\\nIâve prepared the v4 image, so go ahead and trigger the rollout by changing the image\\nto luksa/kubia:v4, but then immediately (within a few seconds) pause the rollout:\\n$ kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v4\\ndeployment \"kubia\" image updated\\n$ kubectl rollout pause deployment kubia\\ndeployment \"kubia\" paused\\nA single new pod should have been created, but all original pods should also still be\\nrunning. Once the new pod is up, a part of all requests to the service will be redirected\\nto the new pod. This way, youâve effectively run a canary release. A canary release is a\\ntechnique for minimizing the risk of rolling out a bad version of an application and it\\naffecting all your users. Instead of rolling out the new version to everyone, you replace\\nonly one or a small number of old pods with new ones. This way only a small number\\nof users will initially hit the new version. You can then verify whether the new version\\n \\n',\n",

Once youâre confident the new\\nversion works as it should, you can resume the deployment to replace all the old pods\\nwith new ones:\\n$ kubectl rollout resume deployment kubia\\ndeployment \"kubia\" resumed\\nObviously, having to pause the deployment at an exact point in the rollout process\\nisnât what you want to do. In the future, a new upgrade strategy may do that automati-\\ncally, but currently, the proper way of performing a canary release is by using two dif-\\nferent Deployments and scaling them appropriately. \\nUSING THE PAUSE FEATURE TO PREVENT ROLLOUTS\\nPausing a Deployment can also be used to prevent updates to the Deployment from\\nkicking off the rollout process, allowing you to make multiple changes to the Deploy-\\nment and starting the rollout only when youâre done making all the necessary changes.\\nOnce youâre ready for changes to take effect, you resume the Deployment and the\\nrollout process will start.\\nNOTE\\nIf a Deployment is paused, the undo command wonât undo it until you\\nresume the Deployment.\\n9.3.6\\nBlocking rollouts of bad versions\\nBefore you conclude this chapter, we need to discuss one more property of the Deploy-\\nment resource. Remember the minReadySeconds property you set on the Deployment\\nat the beginning of section 9.3.2? You used it to slow down the rollout, so you could see\\nit was indeed performing a rolling update and not replacing all the pods at once. The\\nmain function of minReadySeconds is to prevent deploying malfunctioning versions, not\\nslowing down a deployment for fun. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE APPLICABILITY OF MINREADYSECONDS\\nThe minReadySeconds property specifies how long a newly created pod should be\\nready before the pod is treated as available. Until the pod is available, the rollout pro-\\ncess will not continue (remember the maxUnavailable property?). A pod is ready\\nwhen readiness probes of all its containers return a success. If a new pod isnât func-\\ntioning properly and its readiness probe starts failing before minReadySeconds have\\npassed, the rollout of the new version will effectively be blocked.\\n You used this property to slow down your rollout process by having Kubernetes\\nwait 10 seconds after a pod was ready before continuing with the rollout. Usually,\\nyouâd set minReadySeconds to something much higher to make sure pods keep report-\\ning theyâre ready after theyâve already started receiving actual traffic. \\n \\n',\n",

The pod is shown\\nas not ready, but I guess youâve been expecting that, right? What has happened?\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW A READINESS PROBE PREVENTS BAD VERSIONS FROM BEING ROLLED OUT\\nAs soon as your new pod starts, the readiness probe starts being hit every second (you\\nset the probeâs interval to one second in the pod spec). On the fifth request the readi-\\nness probe began failing, because your app starts returning HTTP status code 500\\nfrom the fifth request onward. \\n As a result, the pod is removed as an endpoint from the service (see figure 9.14).\\nBy the time you start hitting the service in the curl loop, the pod has already been\\nmarked as not ready. This explains why you never hit the new pod with curl. And\\nthatâs exactly what you want, because you donât want clients to hit a pod thatâs not\\nfunctioning properly.\\nBut what about the rollout process? The rollout status command shows only one\\nnew replica has started. Thankfully, the rollout process will not continue, because the\\nnew pod will never become available. To be considered available, it needs to be ready\\nfor at least 10 seconds. Until itâs available, the rollout process will not create any new\\npods, and it also wonât remove any original pods because youâve set the maxUnavailable\\nproperty to 0. \\nService\\ncurl\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v2\\nPod: v3\\n(unhealthy)\\nPod: v2\\nReplicaSet: v2\\nReplicas: 3\\nDeployment\\nReplicas: 3\\nrollingUpdate:\\nmaxSurge: 1\\nmaxUnavailable: 0\\nReplicaSet: v3\\nReplicas: 1\\nRequests are not forwarded\\nto v3 pod because of failed\\nreadiness probe\\nFigure 9.14\\nDeployment blocked by a failing readiness probe in the new pod\\n \\n',\n",

A few users may have experienced the internal server\\nerror, but thatâs not as big of a problem as if the rollout had replaced all pods with the\\nfaulty version 3.\\nTIP\\nIf you only define the readiness probe without setting minReadySeconds\\nproperly, new pods are considered available immediately when the first invo-\\ncation of the readiness probe succeeds. If the readiness probe starts failing\\nshortly after, the bad version is rolled out across all pods. Therefore, you\\nshould set minReadySeconds appropriately.\\nCONFIGURING A DEADLINE FOR THE ROLLOUT\\nBy default, after the rollout canât make any progress in 10 minutes, itâs considered as\\nfailed.

These replicas\\ndonât differ from each other, apart from their name and IP address. If the pod tem-\\nplate includes a volume, which refers to a specific PersistentVolumeClaim, all replicas\\nof the ReplicaSet will use the exact same PersistentVolumeClaim and therefore the\\nsame PersistentVolume bound by the claim (shown in figure 10.1).\\nBecause the reference to the claim is in the pod template, which is used to stamp out\\nmultiple pod replicas, you canât make each replica use its own separate Persistent-\\nVolumeClaim. You canât use a ReplicaSet to run a distributed data store, where each\\ninstance needs its own separate storageâat least not by using a single ReplicaSet. To\\nbe honest, none of the API objects youâve seen so far make running such a data store\\npossible.

ReplicaSets create exact copies (replicas) of a pod; therefore you canât use\\nthem for these types of pods. What can you use?\\nCREATING PODS MANUALLY\\nYou could create pods manually and have each of them use its own PersistentVolume-\\nClaim, but because no ReplicaSet looks after them, youâd need to manage them man-\\nually and recreate them when they disappear (as in the event of a node failure).\\nTherefore, this isnât a viable option.\\nUSING ONE REPLICASET PER POD INSTANCE\\nInstead of creating pods directly, you could create multiple ReplicaSetsâone for each\\npod with each ReplicaSetâs desired replica count set to one, and each ReplicaSetâs pod\\ntemplate referencing a dedicated PersistentVolumeClaim (as shown in figure 10.2).\\n Although this takes care of the automatic rescheduling in case of node failures or\\naccidental pod deletions, itâs much more cumbersome compared to having a single\\nReplicaSet.

For certain apps, starting up with the old instanceâs data but with a\\ncompletely new network identity may cause problems.\\n Why do certain apps mandate a stable network identity? This requirement is\\nfairly common in distributed stateful applications. Certain apps require the adminis-\\ntrator to list all the other cluster members and their IP addresses (or hostnames) in\\neach memberâs configuration file.

The proper\\nclean and simple way of running these special types of applications in Kubernetes is\\nthrough a StatefulSet. \\n10.2\\nUnderstanding StatefulSets\\nInstead of using a ReplicaSet to run these types of pods, you create a StatefulSet\\nresource, which is specifically tailored to applications where instances of the applica-\\ntion must be treated as non-fungible individuals, with each one having a stable name\\nand state. \\n10.2.1 Comparing StatefulSets with ReplicaSets\\nTo understand the purpose of StatefulSets, itâs best to compare them to ReplicaSets or\\nReplicationControllers. But first let me explain them with a little analogy thatâs widely\\nused in the field.\\nUNDERSTANDING STATEFUL PODS WITH THE PETS VS. CATTLE ANALOGY\\nYou may have already heard of the pets vs. cattle analogy. If not, let me explain it. We\\ncan treat our apps either as pets or as cattle. \\nNOTE\\nStatefulSets were initially called PetSets. That name comes from the\\npets vs. cattle analogy explained here.\\nWe tend to treat our app instances as pets, where we give each instance a name and\\ntake care of each instance individually. But itâs usually better to treat instances as cattle\\nand not pay special attention to each individual instance. This makes it easy to replace\\nunhealthy instances without giving it a second thought, similar to the way a farmer\\nreplaces unhealthy cattle. \\n Instances of a stateless app, for example, behave much like heads of cattle. It\\ndoesnât matter if an instance diesâyou can create a new instance and people wonât\\nnotice the difference. \\n On the other hand, with stateful apps, an app instance is more like a pet. When a\\npet dies, you canât go buy a new one and expect people not to notice. To replace a lost\\npet, you need to find a new one that looks and behaves exactly like the old one. In the\\ncase of apps, this means the new instance needs to have the same state and identity as\\nthe old one.\\nCOMPARING STATEFULSETS WITH REPLICASETS OR REPLICATIONCONTROLLERS\\nPod replicas managed by a ReplicaSet or ReplicationController are much like cattle.\\nBecause theyâre mostly stateless, they can be replaced with a completely new pod\\nreplica at any time. Stateful pods require a different approach. When a stateful pod\\ninstance dies (or the node itâs running on fails), the pod instance needs to be resur-\\nrected on another node, but the new instance needs to get the same name, network\\nidentity, and state as the one itâs replacing. This is what happens when the pods are\\nmanaged through a StatefulSet. \\n \\n',\n",

It also allows you to easily scale the number of pets up and down. A\\nStatefulSet, like a ReplicaSet, has a desired replica count field that determines how\\nmany pets you want running at that time. Similar to ReplicaSets, pods are created from\\na pod template specified as part of the StatefulSet (remember the cookie-cutter anal-\\nogy?). But unlike pods created by ReplicaSets, pods created by the StatefulSet arenât\\nexact replicas of each other. Each can have its own set of volumesâin other words,\\nstorage (and thus persistent state)âwhich differentiates it from its peers. Pet pods\\nalso have a predictable (and stable) identity instead of each new pod instance getting\\na completely random one. \\n10.2.2 Providing a stable network identity\\nEach pod created by a StatefulSet is assigned an ordinal index (zero-based), which\\nis then used to derive the podâs name and hostname, and to attach stable storage to\\nthe pod. The names of the pods are thus predictable, because each podâs name is\\nderived from the StatefulSetâs name and the ordinal index of the instance. Rather\\nthan the pods having random names, theyâre nicely organized, as shown in the next\\nfigure.\\nINTRODUCING THE GOVERNING SERVICE\\nBut itâs not all about the pods having a predictable name and hostname. Unlike regu-\\nlar pods, stateful pods sometimes need to be addressable by their hostname, whereas\\nstateless pods usually donât. After all, each stateless pod is like any other. When you\\nneed one, you pick any one of them. But with stateful pods, you usually want to oper-\\nate on a specific pod from the group, because they differ from each other (they hold\\ndifferent state, for example). \\n For this reason, a StatefulSet requires you to create a corresponding governing\\nheadless Service thatâs used to provide the actual network identity to each pod.\\nThrough this Service, each pod gets its own DNS entry, so its peers and possibly other\\nclients in the cluster can address the pod by its hostname. For example, if the govern-\\ning Service belongs to the default namespace and is called foo, and one of the pods\\nReplicaSet A\\nPod A-fewrb\\nPod A-jwqec\\nPod A-dsfwx\\nStatefulSet A\\nPod A-1\\nPod A-2\\nPod A-0\\nFigure 10.5\\nPods created by a StatefulSet have predictable names (and hostnames), \\nunlike those created by a ReplicaSet\\n \\n',\n",

This holds true even for stateful pods.\\nEven if the pod is scheduled to a different node, it will still be available and reachable\\nunder the same hostname as before. \\nSCALING A STATEFULSET\\nScaling the StatefulSet creates a new pod instance with the next unused ordinal index.\\nIf you scale up from two to three instances, the new instance will get index 2 (the exist-\\ning instances obviously have indexes 0 and 1). \\n The nice thing about scaling down a StatefulSet is the fact that you always know\\nwhat pod will be removed. Again, this is also in contrast to scaling down a ReplicaSet,\\nwhere you have no idea what instance will be deleted, and you canât even specify\\nwhich one you want removed first (but this feature may be introduced in the future).\\nScaling down a StatefulSet always removes the instances with the highest ordinal index\\nfirst (shown in figure 10.7). This makes the effects of a scale-down predictable.\\nBecause certain stateful applications donât handle rapid scale-downs nicely, Stateful-\\nSets scale down only one pod instance at a time. A distributed data store, for example,\\nmay lose data if multiple nodes go down at the same time. For example, if a replicated\\ndata store is configured to store two copies of each data entry, in cases where two\\nnodes go down at the same time, a data entry would be lost if it was stored on exactly\\nthose two nodes. If the scale-down was sequential, the distributed data store has time\\nto create an additional replica of the data entry somewhere else to replace the (single)\\nlost copy.\\n For this exact reason, StatefulSets also never permit scale-down operations if any of\\nthe instances are unhealthy. If an instance is unhealthy, and you scale down by one at\\nthe same time, youâve effectively lost two cluster members at once.\\n10.2.3 Providing stable dedicated storage to each stateful instance\\nYouâve seen how StatefulSets ensure stateful pods have a stable identity, but what\\nabout storage?

In chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolume-\\nClaims, which allow persistent storage to be attached to a pod by referencing the\\nPersistentVolumeClaim in the pod by name. Because PersistentVolumeClaims map\\nto PersistentVolumes one-to-one, each pod of a StatefulSet needs to reference a dif-\\nferent PersistentVolumeClaim to have its own separate PersistentVolume. Because\\nall pod instances are stamped from the same pod template, how can they each refer\\nto a different PersistentVolumeClaim? And who creates these claims? Surely youâre\\nnot expected to create as many PersistentVolumeClaims as the number of pods you\\nplan to have in the StatefulSet upfront? Of course not.\\nTEAMING UP POD TEMPLATES WITH VOLUME CLAIM TEMPLATES\\nThe StatefulSet has to create the PersistentVolumeClaims as well, the same way itâs cre-\\nating the pods. For this reason, a StatefulSet can also have one or more volume claim\\ntemplates, which enable it to stamp out PersistentVolumeClaims along with each pod\\ninstance (see figure 10.8).\\nThe PersistentVolumes for the claims can either be provisioned up-front by an admin-\\nistrator or just in time through dynamic provisioning of PersistentVolumes, as explained\\nat the end of chapter 6. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE CREATION AND DELETION OF PERSISTENTVOLUMECLAIMS\\nScaling up a StatefulSet by one creates two or more API objects (the pod and one or\\nmore PersistentVolumeClaims referenced by the pod). Scaling down, however, deletes\\nonly the pod, leaving the claims alone. The reason for this is obvious, if you consider\\nwhat happens when a claim is deleted. After a claim is deleted, the PersistentVolume it\\nwas bound to gets recycled or deleted and its contents are lost. \\n Because stateful pods are meant to run stateful applications, which implies that the\\ndata they store in the volume is important, deleting the claim on scale-down of a Stateful-\\nSet could be catastrophicâespecially since triggering a scale-down is as simple as\\ndecreasing the replicas field of the StatefulSet.

If you accidentally\\nscale down a StatefulSet, you can undo the mistake by scaling up again and the new\\npod will get the same persisted state again (as well as the same name).\\n10.2.4 Understanding StatefulSet guarantees\\nAs youâve seen so far, StatefulSets behave differently from ReplicaSets or Replication-\\nControllers. But this doesnât end with the pods having a stable identity and storage.\\nStatefulSets also have different guarantees regarding their pods. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF STABLE IDENTITY AND STORAGE\\nWhile regular, stateless pods are fungible, stateful pods arenât. Weâve already seen how\\na stateful pod is always replaced with an identical pod (one having the same name and\\nhostname, using the same persistent storage, and so on). This happens when Kuber-\\nnetes sees that the old pod is no longer there (for example, when you delete the pod\\nmanually). \\n But what if Kubernetes canât be sure about the state of the pod? If it creates a\\nreplacement pod with the same identity, two instances of the app with the same iden-\\ntity might be running in the system.

With pods\\nmanaged by a ReplicaSet, this isnât a problem, because the apps are obviously made to\\nwork on the same files. Also, ReplicaSets create pods with a randomly generated iden-\\ntity, so thereâs no way for two processes to run with the same identity. \\nINTRODUCING STATEFULSETâS AT-MOST-ONE SEMANTICS\\nKubernetes must thus take great care to ensure two stateful pod instances are never\\nrunning with the same identity and are bound to the same PersistentVolumeClaim. A\\nStatefulSet must guarantee at-most-one semantics for stateful pod instances. \\n This means a StatefulSet must be absolutely certain that a pod is no longer run-\\nning before it can create a replacement pod. This has a big effect on how node fail-\\nures are handled. Weâll demonstrate this later in the chapter. Before we can do that,\\nhowever, you need to create a StatefulSet and see how it behaves. Youâll also learn a\\nfew more things about them along the way.\\n10.3\\nUsing a StatefulSet\\nTo properly show StatefulSets in action, youâll build your own little clustered data\\nstore.

       "  'text': '300\\nCHAPTER 10\\nStatefulSets: deploying replicated stateful applications\\n How can a pod discover its peers without talking to the API? Is there an existing,\\nwell-known technology you can use that makes this possible? How about the Domain\\nName System (DNS)? Depending on how much you know about DNS, you probably\\nunderstand what an A, CNAME, or MX record is used for. Other lesser-known types of\\nDNS records also exist. One of them is the SRV record.\\nINTRODUCING SRV RECORDS\\nSRV records are used to point to hostnames and ports of servers providing a specific\\nservice. Kubernetes creates SRV records to point to the hostnames of the pods back-\\ning a headless service. \\n Youâre going to list the SRV records for your stateful pods by running the dig DNS\\nlookup tool inside a new temporary pod. This is the command youâll use:\\n$ kubectl run -it srvlookup --image=tutum/dnsutils --rm \\nâ¥ --restart=Never -- dig SRV kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\\nThe command runs a one-off pod (--restart=Never) called srvlookup, which is\\nattached to the console (-it) and is deleted as soon as it terminates (--rm). The\\npod runs a single container from the tutum/dnsutils image and runs the following\\ncommand:\\ndig SRV kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\\nThe following listing shows what the command prints out.\\n...\\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\\nk.d.s.c.l. 30 IN  SRV     10 33 0 kubia-0.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\nk.d.s.c.l. 30 IN  SRV     10 33 0 kubia-1.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\n;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:\\nkubia-0.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 172.17.0.4\\nkubia-1.kubia.default.svc.cluster.local. 30 IN A 172.17.0.6\\n...\\nNOTE\\nIâve had to shorten the actual name to get records to fit into a single\\nline, so kubia.d.s.c.l is actually kubia.default.svc.cluster.local.\\nThe ANSWER SECTION shows two SRV records pointing to the two pods backing your head-\\nless service. Each pod also gets its own A record, as shown in ADDITIONAL SECTION.\\n For a pod to get a list of all the other pods of a StatefulSet, all you need to do is\\nperform an SRV DNS lookup. In Node.js, for example, the lookup is performed\\nlike this:\\ndns.resolveSrv(\"kubia.default.svc.cluster.local\", callBackFunction);\\nYouâll use this command in your app to enable each pod to discover its peers.\\nListing 10.8\\nListing DNS SRV records of your headless Service\\n \\n',\n",

When a client request reaches one of your cluster nodes, it discovers all its\\npeers, gathers data from them, and sends all the data back to the client. Even if you\\nscale the StatefulSet up or down, the pod servicing the clientâs request can always find\\nall the peers running at that time. \\n The app itself isnât that useful, but I hope you found it a fun way to show how\\ninstances of a replicated stateful app can discover their peers and handle horizontal\\nscaling with ease.\\n10.5\\nUnderstanding how StatefulSets deal with node \\nfailures\\nIn section 10.2.4 we stated that Kubernetes must be absolutely sure that a stateful\\npod is no longer running before creating its replacement. When a node fails\\nabruptly, Kubernetes canât know the state of the node or its pods. It canât know\\nwhether the pods are no longer running, or if they still are and are possibly even still\\nreachable, and itâs only the Kubelet that has stopped reporting the nodeâs state to\\nthe master.\\n Because a StatefulSet guarantees that there will never be two pods running with\\nthe same identity and storage, when a node appears to have failed, the StatefulSet can-\\nnot and should not create a replacement pod until it knows for certain that the pod is\\nno longer running. \\n It can only know that when the cluster administrator tells it so. To do that, the\\nadmin needs to either delete the pod or delete the whole node (doing so then deletes\\nall the pods scheduled to the node).\\n As your final exercise in this chapter, youâll look at what happens to StatefulSets\\nand their pods when one of the cluster nodes gets disconnected from the network.\\n10.5.1 Simulating a nodeâs disconnection from the network \\nAs in chapter 4, youâll simulate the node disconnecting from the network by shutting\\ndown the nodeâs eth0 network interface. Because this example requires multiple\\nnodes, you canât run it on Minikube. Youâll use Google Kubernetes Engine instead.\\nSHUTTING DOWN THE NODEâS NETWORK ADAPTER\\nTo shut down a nodeâs eth0 interface, you need to ssh into one of the nodes like this:\\n$ gcloud compute ssh gke-kubia-default-pool-32a2cac8-m0g1\\nListing 10.11\\nReading from the data store\\n \\n\",\n",

List the\\npods again to confirm: \\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-0   1/1       Unknown   0          15m\\nkubia-1   1/1       Running   0          14m\\nkubia-2   1/1       Running   0          13m\\nThatâs strange. You deleted the pod a moment ago and kubectl said it had deleted it.\\nWhy is the same pod still there? \\nNOTE\\nThe kubia-0 pod in the listing isnât a new pod with the same nameâ\\nthis is clear by looking at the AGE column.

Thatâs because the con-\\ntrol plane itself already deleted it (in order to evict it from the node). \\n If you look at listing 10.14 again, youâll see that the podâs status is Terminating.\\nThe pod was already marked for deletion earlier and will be removed as soon as the\\nKubelet on its node notifies the API server that the podâs containers have terminated.\\nBecause the nodeâs network is down, this will never happen. \\nFORCIBLY DELETING THE POD\\nThe only thing you can do is tell the API server to delete the pod without waiting for\\nthe Kubelet to confirm that the pod is no longer running. You do that like this:\\n$ kubectl delete po kubia-0 --force --grace-period 0\\nwarning: Immediate deletion does not wait for confirmation that the running \\nresource has been terminated. The resource may continue to run on the \\ncluster indefinitely.\\npod \"kubia-0\" deleted\\nYou need to use both the --force and --grace-period 0 options. The warning dis-\\nplayed by kubectl notifies you of what you did. If you list the pods again, youâll finally\\nsee a new kubia-0 pod created:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME          READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE\\nkubia-0       0/1       ContainerCreating   0          8s\\nkubia-1       1/1       Running             0          20m\\nkubia-2       1/1       Running             0          19m\\nWARNING\\nDonât delete stateful pods forcibly unless you know the node is no\\nlonger running or is unreachable (and will remain so forever). \\nBefore continuing, you may want to bring the node you disconnected back online.\\nYou can do that by restarting the node through the GCE web console or in a terminal\\nby issuing the following command:\\n$ gcloud compute instances reset <node name>\\n10.6\\nSummary\\nThis concludes the chapter on using StatefulSets to deploy stateful apps.

They donât\\ntalk to each other directly. The API server is the only component that communicates\\nwith etcd. None of the other components communicate with etcd directly, but instead\\nmodify the cluster state by talking to the API server.\\n Connections between the API server and the other components are almost always\\ninitiated by the components, as shown in figure 11.1. But the API server does connect\\nto the Kubelet when you use kubectl to fetch logs, use kubectl attach to connect to\\na running container, or use the kubectl port-forward command.\\nNOTE\\nThe kubectl attach command is similar to kubectl exec, but it attaches\\nto the main process running in the container instead of running an addi-\\ntional one.\\nRUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS\\nAlthough the components on the worker nodes all need to run on the same node,\\nthe components of the Control Plane can easily be split across multiple servers. There\\nChecking the status of the Control Plane components\\nThe API server exposes an API resource called ComponentStatus, which shows the\\nhealth status of each Control Plane component.

While multiple instances of etcd and API server can be active at the\\nsame time and do perform their jobs in parallel, only a single instance of the Sched-\\nuler and the Controller Manager may be active at a given timeâwith the others in\\nstandby mode.\\nHOW COMPONENTS ARE RUN\\nThe Control Plane components, as well as kube-proxy, can either be deployed on the\\nsystem directly or they can run as pods (as shown in listing 11.1). You may be surprised\\nto hear this, but it will all make sense later when we talk about the Kubelet. \\n The Kubelet is the only component that always runs as a regular system compo-\\nnent, and itâs the Kubelet that then runs all the other components as pods. To run the\\nControl Plane components as pods, the Kubelet is also deployed on the master. The\\nnext listing shows pods in the kube-system namespace in a cluster created with\\nkubeadm, which is explained in appendix B.\\n$ kubectl get po -o custom-columns=POD:metadata.name,NODE:spec.nodeName \\nâ¥ --sort-by spec.nodeName -n kube-system\\nPOD                              NODE\\nkube-controller-manager-master   master      \\nkube-dns-2334855451-37d9k        master      \\netcd-master                      master      \\nkube-apiserver-master            master      \\nkube-scheduler-master            master      \\nkube-flannel-ds-tgj9k            node1      \\nkube-proxy-ny3xm                 node1      \\nkube-flannel-ds-0eek8            node2      \\nkube-proxy-sp362                 node2      \\nkube-flannel-ds-r5yf4            node3      \\nkube-proxy-og9ac                 node3      \\nAs you can see in the listing, all the Control Plane components are running as pods on\\nthe master node. There are three worker nodes, and each one runs the kube-proxy\\nand a Flannel pod, which provides the overlay network for the pods (weâll talk about\\nFlannel later). \\nTIP\\nAs shown in the listing, you can tell kubectl to display custom columns\\nwith the -o custom-columns option and sort the resource list with --sort-by.\\nNow, letâs look at each of the components up close, starting with the lowest level com-\\nponent of the Control Planeâthe persistent storage.\\n11.1.2 How Kubernetes uses etcd\\nAll the objects youâve created throughout this bookâPods, ReplicationControllers,\\nServices, Secrets, and so onâneed to be stored somewhere in a persistent manner so\\ntheir manifests survive API server restarts and failures. For this, Kubernetes uses etcd,\\nListing 11.1\\nKubernetes components running as pods\\netcd, API server, Scheduler, \\nController Manager, and \\nthe DNS server are running \\non the master.\\nThe three nodes each run \\na Kube Proxy pod and a \\nFlannel networking pod.\\n \\n',\n",

Because itâs distributed,\\nyou can run more than one etcd instance to provide both high availability and bet-\\nter performance.\\n The only component that talks to etcd directly is the Kubernetes API server. All\\nother components read and write data to etcd indirectly through the API server. This\\nbrings a few benefits, among them a more robust optimistic locking system as well as\\nvalidation; and, by abstracting away the actual storage mechanism from all the other\\ncomponents, itâs much simpler to replace it in the future. Itâs worth emphasizing that\\netcd is the only place Kubernetes stores cluster state and metadata.\\nHOW RESOURCES ARE STORED IN ETCD\\nAs Iâm writing this, Kubernetes can use either etcd version 2 or version 3, but version 3\\nis now recommended because of improved performance. etcd v2 stores keys in a hier-\\narchical key space, which makes key-value pairs similar to files in a file system. Each\\nkey in etcd is either a directory, which contains other keys, or is a regular key with a\\ncorresponding value. etcd v3 doesnât support directories, but because the key format\\nremains the same (keys can include slashes), you can still think of them as being\\ngrouped into directories. Kubernetes stores all its data in etcd under /registry. The\\nfollowing listing shows a list of keys stored under /registry.\\n$ etcdctl ls /registry\\n/registry/configmaps\\n/registry/daemonsets\\n/registry/deployments\\n/registry/events\\n/registry/namespaces\\n/registry/pods\\n...\\nAbout optimistic concurrency control\\nOptimistic concurrency control (sometimes referred to as optimistic locking) is a\\nmethod where instead of locking a piece of data and preventing it from being read or\\nupdated while the lock is in place, the piece of data includes a version number. Every\\ntime the data is updated, the version number increases. When updating the data, the\\nversion number is checked to see if it has increased between the time the client read\\nthe data and the time it submits the update. If this happens, the update is rejected\\nand the client must re-read the new data and try to update it again. \\nThe result is that when two clients try to update the same data entry, only the first\\none succeeds.\\nAll Kubernetes resources include a metadata.resourceVersion field, which clients\\nneed to pass back to the API server when updating an object. If the version doesnât\\nmatch the one stored in etcd, the API server rejects the update.\\nListing 11.2\\nTop-level entries stored in etcd by Kubernetes\\n \\n',\n",

Iâm sure youâd like to know\\nwhy. Letâs compare having two vs. having one instance. Having two instances requires\\nboth instances to be present to have a majority. If either of them fails, the etcd cluster\\ncanât transition to a new state because no majority exists. Having two instances is worse\\nthan having only a single instance. By having two, the chance of the whole cluster fail-\\ning has increased by 100%, compared to that of a single-node cluster failing. \\n The same applies when comparing three vs. four etcd instances. With three instances,\\none instance can fail and a majority (of two) still exists. With four instances, you need\\nthree nodes for a majority (two arenât enough). In both three- and four-instance clus-\\nters, only a single instance may fail. But when running four instances, if one fails, a\\nhigher possibility exists of an additional instance of the three remaining instances fail-\\ning (compared to a three-node cluster with one failed node and two remaining nodes).\\n Usually, for large clusters, an etcd cluster of five or seven nodes is sufficient. It can\\nhandle a two- or a three-node failure, respectively, which suffices in almost all situations. \\n11.1.3 What the API server does\\nThe Kubernetes API server is the central component used by all other components\\nand by clients, such as kubectl. It provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)\\ninterface for querying and modifying the cluster state over a RESTful API. It stores\\nthat state in etcd.\\n In addition to providing a consistent way of storing objects in etcd, it also performs\\nvalidation of those objects, so clients canât store improperly configured objects (which\\nthey could if they were writing to the store directly). Along with validation, it also han-\\ndles optimistic locking, so changes to an object are never overridden by other clients\\nin the event of concurrent updates.\\n One of the API serverâs clients is the command-line tool kubectl youâve been\\nusing from the beginning of the book. When creating a resource from a JSON file, for\\nexample, kubectl posts the fileâs contents to the API server through an HTTP POST\\nrequest. Figure 11.3 shows what happens inside the API server when it receives the\\nrequest. This is explained in more detail in the next few paragraphs.\\nAPI server\\netcd\\nAuthentication\\nplugin 1\\nAuthentication\\nplugin 2\\nAuthentication\\nplugin 3\\nClient\\n(\\n)\\nkubectl\\nHTTP POST\\nrequest\\nAuthorization\\nplugin 1\\nAuthorization\\nplugin 2\\nAuthorization\\nplugin 3\\nAdmission\\ncontrol plugin 1\\nAdmission\\ncontrol plugin 2\\nAdmission\\ncontrol plugin 3\\nResource\\nvalidation\\nFigure 11.3\\nThe operation of the API server\\n \\n',\n",

This is per-\\nformed by one or more authentication plugins configured in the API server. The API\\nserver calls these plugins in turn, until one of them determines who is sending the\\nrequest. It does this by inspecting the HTTP request. \\n Depending on the authentication method, the user can be extracted from the cli-\\nentâs certificate or an HTTP header, such as Authorization, which you used in chap-\\nter 8. The plugin extracts the clientâs username, user ID, and groups the user belongs\\nto. This data is then used in the next stage, which is authorization.\\nAUTHORIZING THE CLIENT WITH AUTHORIZATION PLUGINS\\nBesides authentication plugins, the API server is also configured to use one or more\\nauthorization plugins. Their job is to determine whether the authenticated user can\\nperform the requested action on the requested resource. For example, when creating\\npods, the API server consults all authorization plugins in turn, to determine whether\\nthe user can create pods in the requested namespace. As soon as a plugin says the user\\ncan perform the action, the API server progresses to the next stage.\\nVALIDATING AND/OR MODIFYING THE RESOURCE IN THE REQUEST WITH ADMISSION CONTROL PLUGINS\\nIf the request is trying to create, modify, or delete a resource, the request is sent\\nthrough Admission Control. Again, the server is configured with multiple Admission\\nControl plugins. These plugins can modify the resource for different reasons. They\\nmay initialize fields missing from the resource specification to the configured default\\nvalues or even override them. They may even modify other related resources, which\\narenât in the request, and can also reject a request for whatever reason. The resource\\npasses through all Admission Control plugins.\\nNOTE\\nWhen the request is only trying to read data, the request doesnât go\\nthrough the Admission Control.\\nExamples of Admission Control plugins include\\n\\uf0a1\\nAlwaysPullImagesâOverrides the podâs imagePullPolicy to Always, forcing\\nthe image to be pulled every time the pod is deployed.\\n\\uf0a1\\nServiceAccountâApplies the default service account to pods that donât specify\\nit explicitly.\\n\\uf0a1\\nNamespaceLifecycleâPrevents creation of pods in namespaces that are in the\\nprocess of being deleted, as well as in non-existing namespaces.\\n\\uf0a1\\nResourceQuotaâEnsures pods in a certain namespace only use as much CPU\\nand memory as has been allotted to the namespace. Weâll learn more about this\\nin chapter 14.\\nYouâll find a list of additional Admission Control plugins in the Kubernetes documen-\\ntation at https:/\\n/kubernetes.io/docs/admin/admission-controllers/.\\n \\n',\n",

For example, it\\ndoesnât create pods when you create a ReplicaSet resource and it doesnât manage the\\nendpoints of a service. Thatâs what controllers in the Controller Manager do. \\n But the API server doesnât even tell these controllers what to do. All it does is\\nenable those controllers and other components to observe changes to deployed\\nresources. A Control Plane component can request to be notified when a resource is\\ncreated, modified, or deleted. This enables the component to perform whatever task\\nit needs in response to a change of the cluster metadata.\\n Clients watch for changes by opening an HTTP connection to the API server.\\nThrough this connection, the client will then receive a stream of modifications to the\\nwatched objects. Every time an object is updated, the server sends the new version of\\nthe object to all connected clients watching the object. Figure 11.4 shows how clients\\ncan watch for changes to pods and how a change to one of the pods is stored into etcd\\nand then relayed to all clients watching pods at that moment.\\nOne of the API serverâs clients is the kubectl tool, which also supports watching\\nresources. For example, when deploying a pod, you donât need to constantly poll the list\\nof pods by repeatedly executing kubectl get pods. Instead, you can use the --watch\\nflag and be notified of each creation, modification, or deletion of a pod, as shown in\\nthe following listing.\\n$ kubectl get pods --watch\\nNAME                    READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE\\nListing 11.6\\nWatching a pod being created and then deleted\\nVarious\\nclients\\nkubectl\\nAPI server\\n1.

This is left to the Scheduler. From afar, the operation of the Scheduler looks\\nsimple. All it does is wait for newly created pods through the API serverâs watch mech-\\nanism and assign a node to each new pod that doesnât already have the node set. \\n The Scheduler doesnât instruct the selected node (or the Kubelet running on that\\nnode) to run the pod. All the Scheduler does is update the pod definition through the\\nAPI server. The API server then notifies the Kubelet (again, through the watch mech-\\nanism described previously) that the pod has been scheduled. As soon as the Kubelet\\non the target node sees the pod has been scheduled to its node, it creates and runs the\\npodâs containers.\\n Although a coarse-grained view of the scheduling process seems trivial, the actual\\ntask of selecting the best node for the pod isnât that simple. Sure, the simplest\\nScheduler could pick a random node and not care about the pods already running on\\nthat node. On the other side of the spectrum, the Scheduler could use advanced tech-\\nniques such as machine learning to anticipate what kind of pods are about to be\\nscheduled in the next minutes or hours and schedule pods to maximize future hard-\\nware utilization without requiring any rescheduling of existing pods. Kubernetesâ\\ndefault Scheduler falls somewhere in between. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE DEFAULT SCHEDULING ALGORITHM\\nThe selection of a node can be broken down into two parts, as shown in figure 11.5:\\n\\uf0a1Filtering the list of all nodes to obtain a list of acceptable nodes the pod can be\\nscheduled to.\\n\\uf0a1Prioritizing the acceptable nodes and choosing the best one. If multiple nodes\\nhave the highest score, round-robin is used to ensure pods are deployed across\\nall of them evenly.\\n \\n',\n",

If these two nodes are provided by the cloud infrastructure, it may be bet-\\nter to schedule the pod to the first node and relinquish the second node back to the\\ncloud provider to save money. \\nADVANCED SCHEDULING OF PODS\\nConsider another example. Imagine having multiple replicas of a pod. Ideally, youâd\\nwant them spread across as many nodes as possible instead of having them all sched-\\nuled to a single one. Failure of that node would cause the service backed by those\\npods to become unavailable. But if the pods were spread across different nodes, a sin-\\ngle node failure would barely leave a dent in the serviceâs capacity. \\n Pods belonging to the same Service or ReplicaSet are spread across multiple nodes\\nby default. Itâs not guaranteed that this is always the case. But you can force pods to be\\nspread around the cluster or kept close together by defining pod affinity and anti-\\naffinity rules, which are explained in chapter 16. \\n Even these two simple cases show how complex scheduling can be, because it\\ndepends on a multitude of factors. Because of this, the Scheduler can either be config-\\nured to suit your specific needs or infrastructure specifics, or it can even be replaced\\nwith a custom implementation altogether. You could also run a Kubernetes cluster\\nwithout a Scheduler, but then youâd have to perform the scheduling manually.\\nUSING MULTIPLE SCHEDULERS\\nInstead of running a single Scheduler in the cluster, you can run multiple Schedulers.\\nThen, for each pod, you specify the Scheduler that should schedule this particular\\npod by setting the schedulerName property in the pod spec.\\n Pods without this property set are scheduled using the default Scheduler, and so\\nare pods with schedulerName set to default-scheduler. All other pods are ignored by\\nthe default Scheduler, so they need to be scheduled either manually or by another\\nScheduler watching for such pods. \\n You can implement your own Schedulers and deploy them in the cluster, or you\\ncan deploy an additional instance of Kubernetesâ Scheduler with different configura-\\ntion options.\\n11.1.6 Introducing the controllers running in the Controller Manager\\nAs previously mentioned, the API server doesnât do anything except store resources in\\netcd and notify clients about the change. The Scheduler only assigns a node to the\\npod, so you need other active components to make sure the actual state of the system\\nconverges toward the desired state, as specified in the resources deployed through the\\nAPI server. This work is done by controllers running inside the Controller Manager. \\n The single Controller Manager process currently combines a multitude of control-\\nlers performing various reconciliation tasks. Eventually those controllers will be split\\nup into separate processes, enabling you to replace each one with a custom imple-\\nmentation if necessary. The list of these controllers includes the\\n\\uf0a1Replication Manager (a controller for ReplicationController resources)\\n\\uf0a1ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, and Job controllers\\n \\n',\n",

From the list,\\nyou can tell thereâs a controller for almost every resource you can create. Resources\\nare descriptions of what should be running in the cluster, whereas the controllers are\\nthe active Kubernetes components that perform actual work as a result of the deployed\\nresources.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT CONTROLLERS DO AND HOW THEY DO IT\\nControllers do many different things, but they all watch the API server for changes to\\nresources (Deployments, Services, and so on) and perform operations for each change,\\nwhether itâs a creation of a new object or an update or deletion of an existing object.\\nMost of the time, these operations include creating other resources or updating the\\nwatched resources themselves (to update the objectâs status, for example).\\n In general, controllers run a reconciliation loop, which reconciles the actual state\\nwith the desired state (specified in the resourceâs spec section) and writes the new\\nactual state to the resourceâs status section. Controllers use the watch mechanism to\\nbe notified of changes, but because using watches doesnât guarantee the controller\\nwonât miss an event, they also perform a re-list operation periodically to make sure\\nthey havenât missed anything.\\n Controllers never talk to each other directly. They donât even know any other con-\\ntrollers exist. Each controller connects to the API server and, through the watch\\nmechanism described in section 11.1.3, asks to be notified when a change occurs in\\nthe list of resources of any type the controller is responsible for. \\n Weâll briefly look at what each of the controllers does, but if youâd like an in-depth\\nview of what they do, I suggest you look at their source code directly. The sidebar\\nexplains how to get started.\\nA few pointers on exploring the controllersâ source code\\nIf youâre interested in seeing exactly how these controllers operate, I strongly encour-\\nage you to browse through their source code. To make it easier, here are a few tips:\\nThe source code for the controllers is available at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/\\nkubernetes/blob/master/pkg/controller.\\nEach controller usually has a constructor in which it creates an Informer, which is\\nbasically a listener that gets called every time an API object gets updated.

We talked about how ReplicationControllers work in chapter 4.\\nItâs not the ReplicationControllers that do the actual work, but the Replication Man-\\nager. Letâs quickly review what the controller does, because this will help you under-\\nstand the rest of the controllers.\\n In chapter 4, we said that the operation of a ReplicationController could be\\nthought of as an infinite loop, where in each iteration, the controller finds the num-\\nber of pods matching its pod selector and compares the number to the desired replica\\ncount. \\n Now that you know how the API server can notify clients through the watch\\nmechanism, itâs clear that the controller doesnât poll the pods in every iteration, but\\nis instead notified by the watch mechanism of each change that may affect the\\ndesired replica count or the number of matched pods (see figure 11.6). Any such\\nchanges trigger the controller to recheck the desired vs. actual replica count and act\\naccordingly.\\n You already know that when too few pod instances are running, the Replication-\\nController runs additional instances. But it doesnât actually run them itself. It creates\\nan Informer listens for changes to a specific type of resource. Looking at the con-\\nstructor will show you which resources the controller is watching.\\nNext, go look for the worker() method. In it, youâll find the method that gets invoked\\neach time the controller needs to do something. The actual function is often stored\\nin a field called syncHandler or something similar. This field is also initialized in the\\nconstructor, so thatâs where youâll find the name of the function that gets called.

This is how all controllers operate.\\nTHE REPLICASET, THE DAEMONSET, AND THE JOB CONTROLLERS\\nThe ReplicaSet controller does almost the same thing as the Replication Manager\\ndescribed previously, so we donât have much to add here. The DaemonSet and Job\\ncontrollers are similar. They create Pod resources from the pod template defined in\\ntheir respective resources. Like the Replication Manager, these controllers donât run\\nthe pods, but post Pod definitions to the API server, letting the Kubelet create their\\ncontainers and run them.\\nTHE DEPLOYMENT CONTROLLER\\nThe Deployment controller takes care of keeping the actual state of a deployment in\\nsync with the desired state specified in the corresponding Deployment API object. \\n The Deployment controller performs a rollout of a new version each time a\\nDeployment object is modified (if the modification should affect the deployed pods).\\nIt does this by creating a ReplicaSet and then appropriately scaling both the old and\\nthe new ReplicaSet based on the strategy specified in the Deployment, until all the old\\npods have been replaced with new ones.

It also monitors each nodeâs\\nhealth and evicts pods from unreachable nodes.\\n The Node controller isnât the only component making changes to Node objects.\\nTheyâre also changed by the Kubelet, and can obviously also be modified by users\\nthrough REST API calls. \\nTHE SERVICE CONTROLLER\\nIn chapter 5, when we talked about Services, you learned that a few different types\\nexist.

The Endpoints con-\\ntroller is the active component that keeps the endpoint list constantly updated with\\nthe IPs and ports of pods matching the label selector.\\n As figure 11.7 shows, the controller watches both Services and Pods. When\\nServices are added or updated or Pods are added, updated, or deleted, it selects Pods\\nmatching the Serviceâs pod selector and adds their IPs and ports to the Endpoints\\nresource. Remember, the Endpoints object is a standalone object, so the controller\\ncreates it if necessary. Likewise, it also deletes the Endpoints object when the Service is\\ndeleted.\\nTHE NAMESPACE CONTROLLER\\nRemember namespaces (we talked about them in chapter 3)? Most resources belong\\nto a specific namespace. When a Namespace resource is deleted, all the resources in\\nthat namespace must also be deleted. This is what the Namespace controller does.\\nWhen itâs notified of the deletion of a Namespace object, it deletes all the resources\\nbelonging to the namespace through the API server. \\nTHE PERSISTENTVOLUME CONTROLLER\\nIn chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.\\nOnce a user creates a PersistentVolumeClaim, Kubernetes must find an appropriate\\nPersistentVolume and bind it to the claim. This is performed by the PersistentVolume\\ncontroller. \\n When a PersistentVolumeClaim pops up, the controller finds the best match for\\nthe claim by selecting the smallest PersistentVolume with the access mode matching\\nthe one requested in the claim and the declared capacity above the capacity requested\\nController Manager\\nWatches\\nCreates, modiï¬es,\\nand deletes\\nEndpoints\\ncontroller\\nAPI server\\nService resources\\nPod resources\\nEndpoints resources\\nFigure 11.7\\nThe Endpoints controller watches Service and Pod resources, \\nand manages Endpoints.\\n \\n',\n",

It does this by keeping an ordered list of PersistentVolumes for each\\naccess mode by ascending capacity and returning the first volume from the list.\\n Then, when the user deletes the PersistentVolumeClaim, the volume is unbound\\nand reclaimed according to the volumeâs reclaim policy (left as is, deleted, or emptied).\\nCONTROLLER WRAP-UP\\nYou should now have a good feel for what each controller does and how controllers\\nwork in general. Again, all these controllers operate on the API objects through the\\nAPI server. They donât communicate with the Kubelets directly or issue any kind of\\ninstructions to them. In fact, they donât even know Kubelets exist. After a controller\\nupdates a resource in the API server, the Kubelets and Kubernetes Service Proxies,\\nalso oblivious of the controllersâ existence, perform their work, such as spinning up a\\npodâs containers and attaching network storage to them, or in the case of services, set-\\nting up the actual load balancing across pods. \\n The Control Plane handles one part of the operation of the whole system, so to\\nfully understand how things unfold in a Kubernetes cluster, you also need to under-\\nstand what the Kubelet and the Kubernetes Service Proxy do. Weâll learn that next.\\n11.1.7 What the Kubelet does\\nIn contrast to all the controllers, which are part of the Kubernetes Control Plane and\\nrun on the master node(s), the Kubelet and the Service Proxy both run on the worker\\nnodes, where the actual pods containers run. What does the Kubelet do exactly?\\nUNDERSTANDING THE KUBELETâS JOB\\nIn a nutshell, the Kubelet is the component responsible for everything running on a\\nworker node. Its initial job is to register the node itâs running on by creating a Node\\nresource in the API server. Then it needs to continuously monitor the API server for\\nPods that have been scheduled to the node, and start the podâs containers. It does this\\nby telling the configured container runtime (which is Docker, CoreOSâ rkt, or some-\\nthing else) to run a container from a specific container image. The Kubelet then con-\\nstantly monitors running containers and reports their status, events, and resource\\nconsumption to the API server. \\n The Kubelet is also the component that runs the container liveness probes, restart-\\ning containers when the probes fail. Lastly, it terminates containers when their Pod is\\ndeleted from the API server and notifies the server that the pod has terminated.\\nRUNNING STATIC PODS WITHOUT THE API SERVER\\nAlthough the Kubelet talks to the Kubernetes API server and gets the pod manifests\\nfrom there, it can also run pods based on pod manifest files in a specific local direc-\\ntory as shown in figure 11.8. This feature is used to run the containerized versions of\\nthe Control Plane components as pods, as you saw in the beginning of the chapter.\\n Instead of running Kubernetes system components natively, you can put their pod\\nmanifests into the Kubeletâs manifest directory and have the Kubelet run and manage\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '328\\nCHAPTER 11\\nUnderstanding Kubernetes internals\\nThe kube-proxy got its name because it was an actual proxy, but the current, much\\nbetter performing implementation only uses iptables rules to redirect packets to a\\nrandomly selected backend pod without passing them through an actual proxy server.\\nThis mode is called the iptables proxy mode and is shown in figure 11.10.\\nThe major difference between these two modes is whether packets pass through the\\nkube-proxy and must be handled in user space, or whether theyâre handled only by\\nthe Kernel (in kernel space). This has a major impact on performance. \\n Another smaller difference is that the userspace proxy mode balanced connec-\\ntions across pods in a true round-robin fashion, while the iptables proxy mode\\ndoesnâtâit selects pods randomly. When only a few clients use a service, they may not\\nbe spread evenly across pods. For example, if a service has two backing pods but only\\nfive or so clients, donât be surprised if you see four clients connect to pod A and only\\none client connect to pod B. With a higher number of clients or pods, this problem\\nisnât so apparent.\\n Youâll learn exactly how iptables proxy mode works in section 11.5. \\n11.1.9 Introducing Kubernetes add-ons\\nWeâve now discussed the core components that make a Kubernetes cluster work. But\\nin the beginning of the chapter, we also listed a few add-ons, which although not\\nalways required, enable features such as DNS lookup of Kubernetes services, exposing\\nmultiple HTTP services through a single external IP address, the Kubernetes web\\ndashboard, and so on.\\nHOW ADD-ONS ARE DEPLOYED\\nThese components are available as add-ons and are deployed as pods by submitting\\nYAML manifests to the API server, the way youâve been doing throughout the book.\\nSome of these components are deployed through a Deployment resource or a Repli-\\ncationController resource, and some through a DaemonSet. \\n For example, as Iâm writing this, in Minikube, the Ingress controller and the\\ndashboard add-ons are deployed as ReplicationControllers, as shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\n \\nClient\\nConï¬gures\\n:\\niptables\\nredirect straight to pod\\n(no proxy server in-between)\\niptables\\nPod\\nkube-proxy\\nFigure 11.10\\nThe iptables proxy mode\\n \\n',\n",

This allows pods to easily look up services by name or even the podâs IP\\naddresses in the case of headless services.\\n The DNS server pod is exposed through the kube-dns service, allowing the pod to\\nbe moved around the cluster, like any other pod. The serviceâs IP address is specified\\nas the nameserver in the /etc/resolv.conf file inside every container deployed in the\\ncluster. The kube-dns pod uses the API serverâs watch mechanism to observe changes\\nto Services and Endpoints and updates its DNS records with every change, allowing its\\nclients to always get (fairly) up-to-date DNS information. I say fairly because during\\nthe time between the update of the Service or Endpoints resource and the time the\\nDNS pod receives the watch notification, the DNS records may be invalid.\\nHOW (MOST) INGRESS CONTROLLERS WORK\\nUnlike the DNS add-on, youâll find a few different implementations of Ingress con-\\ntrollers, but most of them work in the same way. An Ingress controller runs a reverse\\nproxy server (like Nginx, for example), and keeps it configured according to the\\nIngress, Service, and Endpoints resources defined in the cluster. The controller thus\\nneeds to observe those resources (again, through the watch mechanism) and change\\nthe proxy serverâs config every time one of them changes. \\n Although the Ingress resourceâs definition points to a Service, Ingress controllers\\nforward traffic to the serviceâs pod directly instead of going through the service IP.\\nThis affects the preservation of client IPs when external clients connect through the\\nIngress controller, which makes them preferred over Services in certain use cases.\\nUSING OTHER ADD-ONS\\nYouâve seen how both the DNS server and the Ingress controller add-ons are similar to\\nthe controllers running in the Controller Manager, except that they also accept client\\nconnections instead of only observing and modifying resources through the API server. \\nListing 11.7\\nAdd-ons deployed with ReplicationControllers in Minikube\\nListing 11.8\\nThe kube-dns Deployment \\n \\n',\n",

The controller takes into consideration the replica count and pod selec-\\ntor defined in the ReplicaSet and verifies whether enough existing Pods match\\nthe selector.\\n The controller then creates the Pod resources based on the pod template in the\\nReplicaSet (the pod template was copied over from the Deployment when the Deploy-\\nment controller created the ReplicaSet). \\nTHE SCHEDULER ASSIGNS A NODE TO THE NEWLY CREATED PODS\\nThese newly created Pods are now stored in etcd, but they each still lack one import-\\nant thingâthey donât have an associated node yet. Their nodeName attribute isnât set.\\nThe Scheduler watches for Pods like this, and when it encounters one, chooses the\\nbest node for the Pod and assigns the Pod to the node. The Podâs definition now\\nincludes the name of the node it should be running on.\\n Everything so far has been happening in the Kubernetes Control Plane. None of\\nthe controllers that have taken part in this whole process have done anything tangible\\nexcept update the resources through the API server. \\nTHE KUBELET RUNS THE PODâS CONTAINERS\\nThe worker nodes havenât done anything up to this point. The podâs containers\\nhavenât been started yet. The images for the podâs containers havenât even been down-\\nloaded yet. \\n But with the Pod now scheduled to a specific node, the Kubelet on that node can\\nfinally get to work. The Kubelet, watching for changes to Pods on the API server, sees a\\nnew Pod scheduled to its node, so it inspects the Pod definition and instructs Docker,\\nor whatever container runtime itâs using, to start the podâs containers. The container\\nruntime then runs the containers.\\n11.2.3 Observing cluster events\\nBoth the Control Plane components and the Kubelet emit events to the API server as\\nthey perform these actions. They do this by creating Event resources, which are like\\nany other Kubernetes resource. Youâve already seen events pertaining to specific\\nresources every time you used kubectl describe to inspect those resources, but you\\ncan also retrieve events directly with kubectl get events.\\n Maybe itâs me, but using kubectl get to inspect events is painful, because theyâre\\nnot shown in proper temporal order. Instead, if an event occurs multiple times, the\\nevent is displayed only once, showing when it was first seen, when it was last seen, and\\nthe number of times it occurred. Luckily, watching events with the --watch option is\\nmuch easier on the eyes and useful for seeing whatâs happening in the cluster. \\n The following listing shows the events emitted in the process described previously\\n(some columns have been removed and the output is edited heavily to make it legible\\nin the limited space on the page).\\n \\n',\n",

If you look closely, youâll see that this container was\\ncreated a few seconds before the Nginx container. Whatâs its role?\\n This pause container is the container that holds all the containers of a pod\\ntogether. Remember how all containers of a pod share the same network and other\\nLinux namespaces? The pause container is an infrastructure container whose sole\\npurpose is to hold all these namespaces. All other user-defined containers of the pod\\nthen use the namespaces of the pod infrastructure container (see figure 11.13).\\nActual application containers may die and get restarted. When such a container starts\\nup again, it needs to become part of the same Linux namespaces as before. The infra-\\nstructure container makes this possible since its lifecycle is tied to that of the podâthe\\ncontainer runs from the time the pod is scheduled until the pod is deleted. If the\\ninfrastructure pod is killed in the meantime, the Kubelet recreates it and all the podâs\\ncontainers.\\nListing 11.10\\nListing running Docker containers\\nPod\\nContainer A\\nContainer A\\nPod infrastructure\\ncontainer\\nContainer B\\nContainer B\\nUses Linux\\nnamespaces from\\nUses Linux\\nnamespaces from\\nFigure 11.13\\nA two-container pod results in three running containers \\nsharing the same Linux namespaces.\\n \\n',\n",

When pod A connects to (sends a network packet to) pod B,\\nthe source IP pod B sees must be the same IP that pod A sees as its own. There should\\nbe no network address translation (NAT) performed in betweenâthe packet sent by\\npod A must reach pod B with both the source and destination address unchanged.\\nThis is important, because it makes networking for applications running inside pods\\nsimple and exactly as if they were running on machines connected to the same net-\\nwork switch.

Pod X connects to pod Y and tells it,\\nâHey, Iâm pod X, available at IP 1.2.3.4; please send updates to me at this IP address.â\\nThe pod providing the service can connect to the first pod by using the received\\nIP address. \\n The requirement for NAT-less communication between pods also extends to pod-\\nto-node and node-to-pod communication. But when a pod communicates with ser-\\nvices out on the internet, the source IP of the packets the pod sends does need to be\\nchanged, because the podâs IP is private. The source IP of outbound packets is\\nchanged to the host worker nodeâs IP address.\\n Building a proper Kubernetes cluster involves setting up the networking according\\nto these requirements. There are various methods and technologies available to do\\nthis, each with its own benefits or drawbacks in a given scenario. Because of this, weâre\\nnot going to go into specific technologies. Instead, letâs explain how inter-pod net-\\nworking works in general. \\n11.4.2 Diving deeper into how networking works\\nIn section 11.3, we saw that a podâs IP address and network namespace are set up and\\nheld by the infrastructure container (the pause container). The podâs containers then\\nuse its network namespace. A podâs network interface is thus whatever is set up in the\\ninfrastructure container. Letâs see how the interface is created and how itâs connected\\nto the interfaces in all the other pods. Look at figure 11.15. Weâll discuss it next.\\nENABLING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PODS ON THE SAME NODE\\nBefore the infrastructure container is started, a virtual Ethernet interface pair (a veth\\npair) is created for the container. One interface of the pair remains in the hostâs\\nnamespace (youâll see it listed as vethXXX when you run ifconfig on the node),\\nwhereas the other is moved into the containerâs network namespace and renamed\\neth0. The two virtual interfaces are like two ends of a pipe (or like two network\\ndevices connected by an Ethernet cable)âwhat goes in on one side comes out on the\\nother, and vice-versa. \\nNode\\nPod A\\neth0\\n10.1.1.1\\nveth123\\nPod B\\neth0\\n10.1.1.2\\nveth234\\nBridge\\n10.1.1.0/24\\nThis is pod Aâs\\nveth pair.\\nThis is pod Bâs\\nveth pair.\\nFigure 11.15\\nPods on a node are \\nconnected to the same bridge through \\nvirtual Ethernet interface pairs.\\n \\n',\n",

The eth0 interface in the container is\\nassigned an IP address from the bridgeâs address range. Anything that an application\\nrunning inside the container sends to the eth0 network interface (the one in the con-\\ntainerâs namespace), comes out at the other veth interface in the hostâs namespace\\nand is sent to the bridge. This means it can be received by any network interface thatâs\\nconnected to the bridge. \\n If pod A sends a network packet to pod B, the packet first goes through pod Aâs\\nveth pair to the bridge and then through pod Bâs veth pair. All containers on a node\\nare connected to the same bridge, which means they can all communicate with each\\nother. But to enable communication between containers running on different nodes,\\nthe bridges on those nodes need to be connected somehow. \\nENABLING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PODS ON DIFFERENT NODES\\nYou have many ways to connect bridges on different nodes. This can be done with\\noverlay or underlay networks or by regular layer 3 routing, which weâll look at next.\\n You know pod IP addresses must be unique across the whole cluster, so the bridges\\nacross the nodes must use non-overlapping address ranges to prevent pods on differ-\\nent nodes from getting the same IP. In the example shown in figure 11.16, the bridge\\non node A is using the 10.1.1.0/24 IP range and the bridge on node B is using\\n10.1.2.0/24, which ensures no IP address conflicts exist.\\n Figure 11.16 shows that to enable communication between pods across two nodes\\nwith plain layer 3 networking, the nodeâs physical network interface needs to be con-\\nnected to the bridge as well. Routing tables on node A need to be configured so all\\npackets destined for 10.1.2.0/24 are routed to node B, whereas node Bâs routing\\ntables need to be configured so packets sent to 10.1.1.0/24 are routed to node A.\\n With this type of setup, when a packet is sent by a container on one of the nodes\\nto a container on the other node, the packet first goes through the veth pair, then\\nNode A\\nPod A\\nNetwork\\neth0\\n10.1.1.1\\nveth123\\nPod B\\neth0\\n10.1.1.2\\nveth234\\nBridge\\n10.1.1.0/24\\neth0\\n10.100.0.1\\nNode B\\nPod C\\neth0\\n10.1.2.1\\nveth345\\nPod D\\neth0\\n10.1.2.2\\nveth456\\nBridge\\n10.1.2.0/24\\neth0\\n10.100.0.2\\nFigure 11.16\\nFor pods on different nodes to communicate, the bridges need to be connected \\nsomehow.\\n \\n',\n",

These plugins include\\n\\uf0a1Calico\\n\\uf0a1Flannel\\n\\uf0a1Romana\\n\\uf0a1Weave Net \\n\\uf0a1And others\\nWeâre not going to go into the details of these plugins; if you want to learn more about\\nthem, refer to https:/\\n/kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/.\\n Installing a network plugin isnât difficult. You only need to deploy a YAML con-\\ntaining a DaemonSet and a few other supporting resources. This YAML is provided\\non each pluginâs project page. As you can imagine, the DaemonSet is used to deploy\\na network agent on all cluster nodes. It then ties into the CNI interface on the node,\\nbut be aware that the Kubelet needs to be started with --network-plugin=cni to\\nuse CNI. \\n11.5\\nHow services are implemented\\nIn chapter 5 you learned about Services, which allow exposing a set of pods at a long-\\nlived, stable IP address and port. In order to focus on what Services are meant for and\\nhow they can be used, we intentionally didnât go into how they work. But to truly\\nunderstand Services and have a better feel for where to look when things donât behave\\nthe way you expect, you need to understand how they are implemented. \\n \\n',\n",

Initially, the kube-proxy was an actual proxy waiting for connections and for\\neach incoming connection, opening a new connection to one of the pods. This was\\ncalled the userspace proxy mode. Later, a better-performing iptables proxy mode\\nreplaced it. This is now the default, but you can still configure Kubernetes to use the\\nold mode if you want.\\n Before we continue, letâs quickly review a few things about Services, which are rele-\\nvant for understanding the next few paragraphs.\\n Weâve learned that each Service gets its own stable IP address and port. Clients\\n(usually pods) use the service by connecting to this IP address and port. The IP\\naddress is virtualâitâs not assigned to any network interfaces and is never listed as\\neither the source or the destination IP address in a network packet when the packet\\nleaves the node. A key detail of Services is that they consist of an IP and port pair (or\\nmultiple IP and port pairs in the case of multi-port Services), so the service IP by itself\\ndoesnât represent anything. Thatâs why you canât ping them. \\n11.5.2 How kube-proxy uses iptables\\nWhen a service is created in the API server, the virtual IP address is assigned to it\\nimmediately. Soon afterward, the API server notifies all kube-proxy agents running on\\nthe worker nodes that a new Service has been created. Then, each kube-proxy makes\\nthat service addressable on the node itâs running on. It does this by setting up a few\\niptables rules, which make sure each packet destined for the service IP/port pair is\\nintercepted and its destination address modified, so the packet is redirected to one of\\nthe pods backing the service. \\n Besides watching the API server for changes to Services, kube-proxy also watches\\nfor changes to Endpoints objects. We talked about them in chapter 5, but let me\\nrefresh your memory, as itâs easy to forget they even exist, because you rarely create\\nthem manually. An Endpoints object holds the IP/port pairs of all the pods that back\\nthe service (an IP/port pair can also point to something other than a pod). Thatâs\\nwhy the kube-proxy must also watch all Endpoints objects. After all, an Endpoints\\nobject changes every time a new backing pod is created or deleted, and when the\\npodâs readiness status changes or the podâs labels change and it falls in or out of scope\\nof the service. \\n Now letâs see how kube-proxy enables clients to connect to those pods through the\\nService. This is shown in figure 11.17.\\n The figure shows what the kube-proxy does and how a packet sent by a client pod\\nreaches one of the pods backing the Service. Letâs examine what happens to the\\npacket when itâs sent by the client pod (pod A in the figure). \\n The packetâs destination is initially set to the IP and port of the Service (in the\\nexample, the Service is at 172.30.0.1:80). Before being sent to the network, the\\n \\n',\n",

It takes time for all the involved controllers to notice\\nthat a node has failed, create the new pod replica, and start the podâs containers.\\nThere will inevitably be a short period of downtime in between. \\nUSING LEADER-ELECTION FOR NON-HORIZONTALLY SCALABLE APPS\\nTo avoid the downtime, you need to run additional inactive replicas along with the\\nactive one and use a fast-acting lease or leader-election mechanism to make sure only\\none is active. In case youâre unfamiliar with leader election, itâs a way for multiple app\\ninstances running in a distributed environment to come to an agreement on which is\\nthe leader. That leader is either the only one performing tasks, while all others are\\nwaiting for the leader to fail and then becoming leaders themselves, or they can all be\\nactive, with the leader being the only instance performing writes, while all the others\\nare providing read-only access to their data, for example. This ensures two instances\\nare never doing the same job, if that would lead to unpredictable system behavior due\\nto race conditions.\\n The mechanism doesnât need to be incorporated into the app itself. You can use a\\nsidecar container that performs all the leader-election operations and signals the\\nmain container when it should become active. Youâll find an example of leader elec-\\ntion in Kubernetes at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/contrib/tree/master/election.\\n Ensuring your apps are highly available is relatively simple, because Kubernetes\\ntakes care of almost everything. But what if Kubernetes itself fails? What if the servers\\nrunning the Kubernetes Control Plane components go down? How are those compo-\\nnents made highly available?\\n \\n',\n",

To make Kubernetes highly available, you need to run\\nmultiple master nodes, which run multiple instances of the following components:\\n\\uf0a1etcd, which is the distributed data store where all the API objects are kept\\n\\uf0a1API server\\n\\uf0a1Controller Manager, which is the process in which all the controllers run\\n\\uf0a1Scheduler\\nWithout going into the actual details of how to install and run these components, letâs\\nsee whatâs involved in making each of these components highly available. Figure 11.18\\nshows an overview of a highly available cluster.\\nRUNNING AN ETCD CLUSTER\\nBecause etcd was designed as a distributed system, one of its key features is the ability\\nto run multiple etcd instances, so making it highly available is no big deal. All you\\nneed to do is run it on an appropriate number of machines (three, five, or seven, as\\nexplained earlier in the chapter) and make them aware of each other. You do this by\\nincluding the list of all the other instances in every instanceâs configuration. For\\nexample, when starting an instance, you specify the IPs and ports where the other etcd\\ninstances can be reached. \\n etcd will replicate data across all its instances, so a failure of one of the nodes when\\nrunning a three-machine cluster will still allow the cluster to accept both read and\\nwrite operations. To increase the fault tolerance to more than a single node, you need\\nto run five or seven etcd nodes, which would allow the cluster to handle two or three\\nNode 1\\nKubelet\\nNode 2\\nKubelet\\nNode 3\\nKubelet\\nNode 4\\nKubelet\\nNode 5\\nKubelet\\n...\\nNode N\\nKubelet\\nLoad\\nbalancer\\nMaster 3\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nMaster 2\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nMaster 1\\netcd\\nAPI server\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[active]\\n[active]\\nFigure 11.18\\nA highly-available cluster with three master nodes\\n \\n',\n",

Having more than seven etcd instances is almost never nec-\\nessary and begins impacting performance.\\nRUNNING MULTIPLE INSTANCES OF THE API SERVER\\nMaking the API server highly available is even simpler. Because the API server is (almost\\ncompletely) stateless (all the data is stored in etcd, but the API server does cache it), you\\ncan run as many API servers as you need, and they donât need to be aware of each other\\nat all. Usually, one API server is collocated with every etcd instance. By doing this, the\\netcd instances donât need any kind of load balancer in front of them, because every API\\nserver instance only talks to the local etcd instance. \\n The API servers, on the other hand, do need to be fronted by a load balancer, so\\nclients (kubectl, but also the Controller Manager, Scheduler, and all the Kubelets)\\nalways connect only to the healthy API server instances. \\nENSURING HIGH AVAILABILITY OF THE CONTROLLERS AND THE SCHEDULER\\nCompared to the API server, where multiple replicas can run simultaneously, run-\\nning multiple instances of the Controller Manager or the Scheduler isnât as simple.\\nBecause controllers and the Scheduler all actively watch the cluster state and act when\\nit changes, possibly modifying the cluster state further (for example, when the desired\\nreplica count on a ReplicaSet is increased by one, the ReplicaSet controller creates an\\nadditional pod), running multiple instances of each of those components would\\nresult in all of them performing the same action. Theyâd be racing each other, which\\ncould cause undesired effects (creating two new pods instead of one, as mentioned in\\nthe previous example).\\n For this reason, when running multiple instances of these components, only one\\ninstance may be active at any given time. Luckily, this is all taken care of by the compo-\\nnents themselves (this is controlled with the --leader-elect option, which defaults to\\ntrue). Each individual component will only be active when itâs the elected leader. Only\\nthe leader performs actual work, whereas all other instances are standing by and waiting\\nfor the current leader to fail. When it does, the remaining instances elect a new leader,\\nwhich then takes over the work. This mechanism ensures that two components are never\\noperating at the same time and doing the same work (see figure 11.19).\\nMaster 3\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nMaster 1\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[active]\\n[active]\\nMaster 2\\nScheduler\\nController\\nManager\\n[standing-by]\\n[standing-by]\\nOnly the controllers in\\nthis Controller Manager\\nare reacting to API\\nresources being created,\\nupdated, and deleted.\\nThese Controller Managers\\nand Schedulers arenât doing\\nanything except waiting to\\nbecome leaders.\\nOnly this Scheduler\\nis scheduling pods.\\nFigure 11.19\\nOnly a single Controller Manager and a single Scheduler are active; others are standing by.\\n \\n',\n",

When collocated, they can talk to the\\nlocal API server directly; otherwise they connect to the API servers through the load\\nbalancer.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE LEADER ELECTION MECHANISM USED IN CONTROL PLANE COMPONENTS\\nWhat I find most interesting here is that these components donât need to talk to each\\nother directly to elect a leader. The leader election mechanism works purely by creat-\\ning a resource in the API server. And itâs not even a special kind of resourceâthe End-\\npoints resource is used to achieve this (abused is probably a more appropriate term).\\n Thereâs nothing special about using an Endpoints object to do this. Itâs used\\nbecause it has no side effects as long as no Service with the same name exists. Any\\nother resource could be used (in fact, the leader election mechanism will soon use\\nConfigMaps instead of Endpoints). \\n Iâm sure youâre interested in how a resource can be used for this purpose. Letâs\\ntake the Scheduler, for example. All instances of the Scheduler try to create (and later\\nupdate) an Endpoints resource called kube-scheduler. Youâll find it in the kube-\\nsystem namespace, as the following listing shows.\\n$ kubectl get endpoints kube-scheduler -n kube-system -o yaml\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Endpoints\\nmetadata:\\n  annotations:\\n    control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader: \\'{\"holderIdentity\":\\n      â¥ \"minikube\",\"leaseDurationSeconds\":15,\"acquireTime\":\\n      â¥ \"2017-05-27T18:54:53Z\",\"renewTime\":\"2017-05-28T13:07:49Z\",\\n      â¥ \"leaderTransitions\":0}\\'\\n  creationTimestamp: 2017-05-27T18:54:53Z\\n  name: kube-scheduler\\n  namespace: kube-system\\n  resourceVersion: \"654059\"\\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/endpoints/kube-scheduler\\n  uid: f847bd14-430d-11e7-9720-080027f8fa4e\\nsubsets: []\\nThe control-plane.alpha.kubernetes.io/leader annotation is the important part.\\nAs you can see, it contains a field called holderIdentity, which holds the name of the\\ncurrent leader. The first instance that succeeds in putting its name there becomes\\nthe leader. Instances race each other to do that, but thereâs always only one winner.\\n Remember the optimistic concurrency we explained earlier? Thatâs what ensures\\nthat if multiple instances try to write their name into the resource only one of them\\nsucceeds. Based on whether the write succeeded or not, each instance knows whether\\nit is or it isnât the leader. \\n Once becoming the leader, it must periodically update the resource (every two sec-\\nonds by default), so all other instances know that itâs still alive.

Youâve already learned that the API server\\nrequires clients to authenticate themselves before theyâre allowed to perform opera-\\ntions on the server. And youâve already seen how pods can authenticate by sending the\\ncontents of the file/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token, which\\nis mounted into each containerâs filesystem through a secret volume.\\n But what exactly does that file represent? Every pod is associated with a Service-\\nAccount, which represents the identity of the app running in the pod. The token file\\nholds the ServiceAccountâs authentication token. When an app uses this token to con-\\nnect to the API server, the authentication plugin authenticates the ServiceAccount\\nand passes the ServiceAccountâs username back to the API server core. Service-\\nAccount usernames are formatted like this:\\nsystem:serviceaccount:<namespace>:<service account name>\\nThe API server passes this username to the configured authorization plugins, which\\ndetermine whether the action the app is trying to perform is allowed to be performed\\nby the ServiceAccount.\\n ServiceAccounts are nothing more than a way for an application running inside a\\npod to authenticate itself with the API server. As already mentioned, applications do\\nthat by passing the ServiceAccountâs token in the request.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE SERVICEACCOUNT RESOURCE\\nServiceAccounts are resources just like Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and so on, and are\\nscoped to individual namespaces. A default ServiceAccount is automatically created\\nfor each namespace (thatâs the one your pods have used all along). \\n You can list ServiceAccounts like you do other resources:\\n$ kubectl get sa\\nNAME      SECRETS   AGE\\ndefault   1         1d\\nNOTE\\nThe shorthand for serviceaccount is sa.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '349\\nUnderstanding authentication\\nAs you can see, the current namespace only contains the default ServiceAccount. Addi-\\ntional ServiceAccounts can be added when required. Each pod is associated with exactly\\none ServiceAccount, but multiple pods can use the same ServiceAccount. As you can\\nsee in figure 12.1, a pod can only use a ServiceAccount from the same namespace.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW SERVICEACCOUNTS TIE INTO AUTHORIZATION\\nYou can assign a ServiceAccount to a pod by specifying the accountâs name in the pod\\nmanifest. If you donât assign it explicitly, the pod will use the default ServiceAccount\\nin the namespace.\\n By assigning different ServiceAccounts to pods, you can control which resources\\neach pod has access to. When a request bearing the authentication token is received\\nby the API server, the server uses the token to authenticate the client sending the\\nrequest and then determines whether or not the related ServiceAccount is allowed to\\nperform the requested operation. The API server obtains this information from the\\nsystem-wide authorization plugin configured by the cluster administrator. One of\\nthe available authorization plugins is the role-based access control (RBAC) plugin,\\nwhich is discussed later in this chapter. From Kubernetes version 1.6 on, the RBAC\\nplugin is the plugin most clusters should use.\\n12.1.3 Creating ServiceAccounts\\nWeâve said every namespace contains its own default ServiceAccount, but additional\\nones can be created if necessary. But why should you bother with creating Service-\\nAccounts instead of using the default one for all your pods? \\n The obvious reason is cluster security. Pods that donât need to read any cluster\\nmetadata should run under a constrained account that doesnât allow them to retrieve\\nor modify any resources deployed in the cluster. Pods that need to retrieve resource\\nmetadata should run under a ServiceAccount that only allows reading those objectsâ\\nmetadata, whereas pods that need to modify those objects should run under their own\\nServiceAccount allowing modifications of API objects. \\nPod\\nNamespace: foo\\nService-\\nAccount:\\ndefault\\nPod\\nPod\\nNamespace: baz\\nPod\\nNamespace: bar\\nPod\\nPod\\nNot possible\\nService-\\nAccount:\\ndefault\\nAnother\\nService-\\nAccount\\nMultiple pods using the\\nsame ServiceAccount\\nFigure 12.1\\nEach pod is associated with a single ServiceAccount in the podâs namespace.\\n \\n',\n",

Adding image pull Secrets to a ServiceAccount saves you from having to add\\nthem to each pod individually. \\n12.1.4 Assigning a ServiceAccount to a pod\\nAfter you create additional ServiceAccounts, you need to assign them to pods.

In\\nearlier versions, if you managed to acquire the authentication token from one of the\\npods, you could use it to do anything you want in the cluster. If you google around,\\nyouâll find demos showing how a path traversal (or directory traversal) attack (where clients\\ncan retrieve files located outside of the web serverâs web root directory) can be used to\\nget the token and use it to run your malicious pods in an insecure Kubernetes cluster.\\n But in version 1.8.0, the RBAC authorization plugin graduated to GA (General\\nAvailability) and is now enabled by default on many clusters (for example, when\\ndeploying a cluster with kubadm, as described in appendix B). RBAC prevents unau-\\nthorized users from viewing or modifying the cluster state. The default Service-\\nAccount isnât allowed to view cluster state, let alone modify it in any way, unless you\\ngrant it additional privileges. To write apps that communicate with the Kubernetes\\nAPI server (as described in chapter 8), you need to understand how to manage\\nauthorization through RBAC-specific resources.\\nNOTE\\nIn addition to RBAC, Kubernetes also includes other authorization\\nplugins, such as the Attribute-based access control (ABAC) plugin, a Web-\\nHook plugin and custom plugin implementations. RBAC is the standard,\\nthough.\\n12.2.1 Introducing the RBAC authorization plugin\\nThe Kubernetes API server can be configured to use an authorization plugin to check\\nwhether an action is allowed to be performed by the user requesting the action. Because\\nthe API server exposes a REST interface, users perform actions by sending HTTP\\nrequests to the server. Users authenticate themselves by including credentials in the\\nrequest (an authentication token, username and password, or a client certificate).\\nUNDERSTANDING ACTIONS\\nBut what actions are there? As you know, REST clients send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,\\nand other types of HTTP requests to specific URL paths, which represent specific\\nREST resources. In Kubernetes, those resources are Pods, Services, Secrets, and so on.\\nHere are a few examples of actions in Kubernetes:\\n\\uf0a1Get Pods\\n\\uf0a1Create Services\\n \\n',\n",

The\\nnouns (Pods, Service, Secrets) obviously map to Kubernetes resources. \\n An authorization plugin such as RBAC, which runs inside the API server, deter-\\nmines whether a client is allowed to perform the requested verb on the requested\\nresource or not.\\nNOTE\\nThe additional verb use is used for PodSecurityPolicy resources, which\\nare explained in the next chapter.\\nBesides applying security permissions to whole resource types, RBAC rules can also\\napply to specific instances of a resource (for example, a Service called myservice).\\nAnd later youâll see that permissions can also apply to non-resource URL paths,\\nbecause not every path the API server exposes maps to a resource (such as the /api\\npath itself or the server health information at /healthz). \\nUNDERSTANDING THE RBAC PLUGIN\\nThe RBAC authorization plugin, as the name suggests, uses user roles as the key factor\\nin determining whether the user may perform the action or not. A subject (which may\\nbe a human, a ServiceAccount, or a group of users or ServiceAccounts) is associated\\nwith one or more roles and each role is allowed to perform certain verbs on certain\\nresources. \\n If a user has multiple roles, they may do anything that any of their roles allows\\nthem to do. If none of the userâs roles contains a permission to, for example, update\\nSecrets, the API server will prevent the user from performing PUT or PATCH requests\\non Secrets.\\n Managing authorization through the RBAC plugin is simple.

First, ensure youâre\\nusing at least version 1.6 of Kubernetes and that the RBAC plugin is the only config-\\nured authorization plugin. There can be multiple plugins enabled in parallel and if\\none of them allows an action to be performed, the action is allowed.\\nNOTE\\nIf youâre using GKE 1.6 or 1.7, you need to explicitly disable legacy autho-\\nrization by creating the cluster with the --no-enable-legacy-authorization\\noption. If youâre using Minikube, you also may need to enable RBAC by start-\\ning Minikube with --extra-config=apiserver.Authorization.Mode=RBAC\\nIf you followed the instructions on how to disable RBAC in chapter 8, nowâs the time\\nto re-enable it by running the following command:\\n$ kubectl delete clusterrolebinding permissive-binding\\nTo try out RBAC, youâll run a pod through which youâll try to talk to the API server,\\nthe way you did in chapter 8. But this time youâll run two pods in different namespaces\\nto see how per-namespace security behaves.\\n In the examples in chapter 8, you ran two containers to demonstrate how an appli-\\ncation in one container uses the other container to talk to the API server. This time,\\nyouâll run a single container (based on the kubectl-proxy image) and use kubectl\\nexec to run curl inside that container directly.

Youâre creating a RoleBinding, which binds\\nthe service-reader Role to the default ServiceAccount in namespace foo. Youâre cre-\\nating the RoleBinding in namespace foo. The RoleBinding and the referenced Service-\\nAccount and Role are shown in figure 12.5.\\nNOTE\\nTo bind a Role to a user instead of a ServiceAccount, use the --user\\nargument to specify the username.

Theyâre not namespaced. Letâs see why\\nyou need them.\\n A regular Role only allows access to resources in the same namespace the Role is\\nin. If you want to allow someone access to resources across different namespaces, you\\nhave to create a Role and RoleBinding in every one of those namespaces. If you want\\nto extend this to all namespaces (this is something a cluster administrator would prob-\\nably need), you need to create the same Role and RoleBinding in each namespace.\\nWhen creating an additional namespace, you have to remember to create the two\\nresources there as well. \\n As youâve learned throughout the book, certain resources arenât namespaced at\\nall (this includes Nodes, PersistentVolumes, Namespaces, and so on). Weâve also\\nmentioned the API server exposes some URL paths that donât represent resources\\n(/healthz for example). Regular Roles canât grant access to those resources or non-\\nresource URLs, but ClusterRoles can.\\n A ClusterRole is a cluster-level resource for allowing access to non-namespaced\\nresources or non-resource URLs or used as a common role to be bound inside individ-\\nual namespaces, saving you from having to redefine the same role in each of them.\\nALLOWING ACCESS TO CLUSTER-LEVEL RESOURCES\\nAs mentioned, a ClusterRole can be used to allow access to cluster-level resources.\\nLetâs look at how to allow your pod to list PersistentVolumes in your cluster. First,\\nyouâll create a ClusterRole called pv-reader:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrole pv-reader --verb=get,list \\nâ¥ --resource=persistentvolumes\\nclusterrole \"pv-reader\" created\\nThe ClusterRoleâs YAML is shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get clusterrole pv-reader -o yaml\\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ClusterRole\\nmetadata:                                       \\n  name: pv-reader                               \\n  resourceVersion: \"39932\"                      \\n  selfLink: ...                                 \\n  uid: e9ac1099-30e2-11e7-955c-080027e6b159     \\nListing 12.12\\nA ClusterRole definition\\nClusterRoles arenât \\nnamespaced, hence \\nno namespace field.\\n \\n',\n",

This means absolutely everyone can access\\nthe URLs listed in the ClusterRole. \\nNOTE\\nGroups are in the domain of the authentication plugin.

This ensures all the default roles and\\nbindings are recreated if you mistakenly delete them or if a newer version of Kuberne-\\ntes uses a different configuration of cluster roles and bindings.\\n You can see the default cluster roles and bindings in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get clusterrolebindings\\nNAME                                           AGE\\ncluster-admin                                  1d\\nsystem:basic-user                              1d\\nsystem:controller:attachdetach-controller      1d\\n...\\nsystem:controller:ttl-controller               1d\\nsystem:discovery                               1d\\nsystem:kube-controller-manager                 1d\\nsystem:kube-dns                                1d\\nsystem:kube-scheduler                          1d\\nsystem:node                                    1d\\nsystem:node-proxier                            1d\\n$ kubectl get clusterroles\\nNAME                                           AGE\\nadmin                                          1d\\ncluster-admin                                  1d\\nedit                                           1d\\nsystem:auth-delegator                          1d\\nsystem:basic-user                              1d\\nsystem:controller:attachdetach-controller      1d\\n...\\nsystem:controller:ttl-controller               1d\\nsystem:discovery                               1d\\nsystem:heapster                                1d\\nsystem:kube-aggregator                         1d\\nsystem:kube-controller-manager                 1d\\nsystem:kube-dns                                1d\\nsystem:kube-scheduler                          1d\\nsystem:node                                    1d\\nsystem:node-bootstrapper                       1d\\nsystem:node-problem-detector                   1d\\nsystem:node-proxier                            1d\\nsystem:persistent-volume-provisioner           1d\\nview                                           1d\\nListing 12.17\\nListing all ClusterRoleBindings and ClusterRoles\\n \\n',\n",

It allows read-\\ning most resources in a namespace, except for Roles, RoleBindings, and Secrets. Youâre\\nprobably wondering, why not Secrets? Because one of those Secrets might include an\\nauthentication token with greater privileges than those defined in the view Cluster-\\nRole and could allow the user to masquerade as a different user to gain additional\\nprivileges (privilege escalation). \\nALLOWING MODIFYING RESOURCES WITH THE EDIT CLUSTERROLE\\nNext is the edit ClusterRole, which allows you to modify resources in a namespace,\\nbut also allows both reading and modifying Secrets. It doesnât, however, allow viewing\\nor modifying Roles or RoleBindingsâagain, this is to prevent privilege escalation.\\nGRANTING FULL CONTROL OF A NAMESPACE WITH THE ADMIN CLUSTERROLE\\nComplete control of the resources in a namespace is granted in the admin Cluster-\\nRole. Subjects with this ClusterRole can read and modify any resource in the name-\\nspace, except ResourceQuotas (weâll learn what those are in chapter 14) and the\\nNamespace resource itself. The main difference between the edit and the admin Cluster-\\nRoles is in the ability to view and modify Roles and RoleBindings in the namespace.\\nNOTE\\nTo prevent privilege escalation, the API server only allows users to cre-\\nate and update Roles if they already have all the permissions listed in that\\nRole (and for the same scope). \\nALLOWING COMPLETE CONTROL WITH THE CLUSTER-ADMIN CLUSTERROLE \\nComplete control of the Kubernetes cluster can be given by assigning the cluster-\\nadmin ClusterRole to a subject. As youâve seen before, the admin ClusterRole doesnât\\nallow users to modify the namespaceâs ResourceQuota objects or the Namespace\\nresource itself. If you want to allow a user to do that, you need to create a RoleBinding\\nthat references the cluster-admin ClusterRole. This gives the user included in the\\nRoleBinding complete control over all aspects of the namespace in which the Role-\\nBinding is created.\\n If youâve paid attention, you probably already know how to give users complete\\ncontrol of all the namespaces in the cluster. Yes, by referencing the cluster-admin\\nClusterRole in a ClusterRoleBinding instead of a RoleBinding.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE OTHER DEFAULT CLUSTERROLES\\nThe list of default ClusterRoles includes a large number of other ClusterRoles, which\\nstart with the system: prefix. These are meant to be used by the various Kubernetes\\ncomponents. Among them, youâll find roles such as system:kube-scheduler, which\\nis obviously used by the Scheduler, system:node, which is used by the Kubelets, and\\nso on. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '373\\nSummary\\n Although the Controller Manager runs as a single pod, each controller running\\ninside it can use a separate ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding (theyâre prefixed\\nwith system: controller:). \\n Each of these system ClusterRoles has a matching ClusterRoleBinding, which binds\\nit to the user the system component authenticates as. The system:kube-scheduler\\nClusterRoleBinding, for example, assigns the identically named ClusterRole to the\\nsystem:kube-scheduler user, which is the username the scheduler Authenticates as. \\n12.2.6 Granting authorization permissions wisely\\nBy default, the default ServiceAccount in a namespace has no permissions other than\\nthose of an unauthenticated user (as you may remember from one of the previous\\nexamples, the system:discovery ClusterRole and associated binding allow anyone to\\nmake GET requests on a few non-resource URLs). Therefore, pods, by default, canât\\neven view cluster state. Itâs up to you to grant them appropriate permissions to do that. \\n Obviously, giving all your ServiceAccounts the cluster-admin ClusterRole is a\\nbad idea. As is always the case with security, itâs best to give everyone only the permis-\\nsions they need to do their job and not a single permission more (principle of least\\nprivilege).\\nCREATING SPECIFIC SERVICEACCOUNTS FOR EACH POD\\nItâs a good idea to create a specific ServiceAccount for each pod (or a set of pod rep-\\nlicas) and then associate it with a tailor-made Role (or a ClusterRole) through a\\nRoleBinding (not a ClusterRoleBinding, because that would give the pod access to\\nresources in other namespaces, which is probably not what you want). \\n If one of your pods (the application running within it) only needs to read pods,\\nwhile the other also needs to modify them, then create two different ServiceAccounts\\nand make those pods use them by specifying the serviceAccountName property in the\\npod spec, as you learned in the first part of this chapter. Donât add all the necessary\\npermissions required by both pods to the default ServiceAccount in the namespace. \\nEXPECTING YOUR APPS TO BE COMPROMISED\\nYour aim is to reduce the possibility of an intruder getting hold of your cluster. Todayâs\\ncomplex apps contain many vulnerabilities. You should expect unwanted persons to\\neventually get their hands on the ServiceAccountâs authentication token, so you should\\nalways constrain the ServiceAccount to prevent them from doing any real damage.\\n12.3\\nSummary\\nThis chapter has given you a foundation on how to secure the Kubernetes API server.\\nYou learned the following:\\n\\uf0a1Clients of the API server include both human users and applications running\\nin pods.\\n\\uf0a1Applications in pods are associated with a ServiceAccount. \\n\\uf0a1Both users and ServiceAccounts are associated with groups.\\n \\n',\n",

Likewise, each pod has its own process tree, because\\nit has its own PID namespace, and it also uses its own IPC namespace, allowing only\\nprocesses in the same pod to communicate with each other through the Inter-Process\\nCommunication mechanism (IPC).\\n13.1.1 Using the nodeâs network namespace in a pod\\nCertain pods (usually system pods) need to operate in the hostâs default namespaces,\\nallowing them to see and manipulate node-level resources and devices. For example, a\\npod may need to use the nodeâs network adapters instead of its own virtual network\\nadapters. This can be achieved by setting the hostNetwork property in the pod spec\\nto true.\\n In that case, the pod gets to use the nodeâs network interfaces instead of having its\\nown set, as shown in figure 13.1. This means the pod doesnât get its own IP address and\\nif it runs a process that binds to a port, the process will be bound to the nodeâs port.\\nYou can try running such a pod.

If you have multiple nodes, youâll see you canât access the pod through that\\nport on the other nodes. \\nNOTE\\nIf youâre trying this on GKE, you need to configure the firewall prop-\\nerly using gcloud compute firewall-rules, the way you did in chapter 5.\\nThe hostPort feature is primarily used for exposing system services, which are\\ndeployed to every node using DaemonSets. Initially, people also used it to ensure two\\nreplicas of the same pod were never scheduled to the same node, but now you have a\\nbetter way of achieving thisâitâs explained in chapter 16.\\n13.1.3 Using the nodeâs PID and IPC namespaces\\nSimilar to the hostNetwork option are the hostPID and hostIPC pod spec properties.\\nWhen you set them to true, the podâs containers will use the nodeâs PID and IPC\\nnamespaces, allowing processes running in the containers to see all the other pro-\\ncesses on the node or communicate with them through IPC, respectively. See the fol-\\nlowing listing for an example.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-with-host-pid-and-ipc\\nspec:\\n  hostPID: true                    \\n  hostIPC: true                     \\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: alpine\\n    command: [\"/bin/sleep\", \"999999\"]\\nListing 13.3\\nBinding a pod to a port in the nodeâs port space: kubia-hostport.yaml\\nListing 13.4\\nUsing the hostâs PID and IPC namespaces: pod-with-host-pid-and-ipc.yaml\\nThe container can be \\nreached on port 8080 \\nof the podâs IP.\\nIt can also be reached \\non port 9000 of the \\nnode itâs deployed on.\\nYou want the pod to \\nuse the hostâs PID \\nnamespace.\\nYou also want the \\npod to use the hostâs \\nIPC namespace.\\n \\n',\n",

What if an attacker gets access to your image registry and pushes a different\\nimage under the same tag? The attackerâs image is configured to run as the root user.\\nWhen Kubernetes schedules a new instance of your pod, the Kubelet will download\\nthe attackerâs image and run whatever code they put into it. \\n Although containers are mostly isolated from the host system, running their pro-\\ncesses as root is still considered a bad practice. For example, when a host directory is\\nmounted into the container, if the process running in the container is running as\\nroot, it has full access to the mounted directory, whereas if itâs running as non-root,\\nit wonât. \\n To prevent the attack scenario described previously, you can specify that the podâs\\ncontainer needs to run as a non-root user, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-run-as-non-root\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: alpine\\n    command: [\"/bin/sleep\", \"999999\"]\\n    securityContext:                   \\n      runAsNonRoot: true               \\nIf you deploy this pod, it gets scheduled, but is not allowed to run:\\n$ kubectl get po pod-run-as-non-root\\nNAME                 READY  STATUS                                                  \\npod-run-as-non-root  0/1    container has runAsNonRoot and image will run \\n                            â¥  as root\\nNow, if anyone tampers with your container images, they wonât get far.\\n13.2.3 Running pods in privileged mode\\nSometimes pods need to do everything that the node theyâre running on can do, such\\nas use protected system devices or other kernel features, which arenât accessible to\\nregular containers. \\nListing 13.7\\nPreventing containers from running as root: pod-run-as-non-root.yaml\\nThis container will only \\nbe allowed to run as a \\nnon-root user.\\n \\n',\n",

If you follow the\\ninstructions in appendix B and deploy a cluster with kubeadm, youâll see every cluster\\nnode runs a kube-proxy pod and you can examine its YAML specification to see all the\\nspecial features itâs using. \\n To get full access to the nodeâs kernel, the podâs container runs in privileged\\nmode. This is achieved by setting the privileged property in the containerâs security-\\nContext property to true. Youâll create a privileged pod from the YAML in the follow-\\ning listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-privileged\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: alpine\\n    command: [\"/bin/sleep\", \"999999\"]\\n    securityContext:\\n      privileged: true     \\nGo ahead and deploy this pod, so you can compare it with the non-privileged pod you\\nran earlier. \\n If youâre familiar with Linux, you may know it has a special file directory called /dev,\\nwhich contains device files for all the devices on the system. These arenât regular files on\\ndisk, but are special files used to communicate with devices. Letâs see what devices are\\nvisible in the non-privileged container you deployed earlier (the pod-with-defaults\\npod), by listing files in its /dev directory, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl exec -it pod-with-defaults ls /dev\\ncore             null             stderr           urandom\\nfd               ptmx             stdin            zero\\nfull             pts              stdout\\nfuse             random           termination-log\\nmqueue           shm              tty\\nThe listing shows all the devices.

In fact, the privileged container sees\\nall the host nodeâs devices. This means it can use any device freely. \\n For example, I had to use privileged mode like this when I wanted a pod running\\non a Raspberry Pi to control LEDs connected it.\\n13.2.4 Adding individual kernel capabilities to a container\\nIn the previous section, you saw one way of giving a container unlimited power. In the\\nold days, traditional UNIX implementations only distinguished between privileged\\nand unprivileged processes, but for many years, Linux has supported a much more\\nfine-grained permission system through kernel capabilities.\\n Instead of making a container privileged and giving it unlimited permissions, a\\nmuch safer method (from a security perspective) is to give it access only to the kernel\\nfeatures it really requires. Kubernetes allows you to add capabilities to each container\\nor drop part of them, which allows you to fine-tune the containerâs permissions and\\nlimit the impact of a potential intrusion by an attacker.\\n For example, a container usually isnât allowed to change the system time (the hard-\\nware clockâs time). You can confirm this by trying to set the time in your pod-with-\\ndefaults pod:\\n$ kubectl exec -it pod-with-defaults -- date +%T -s \"12:00:00\"\\ndate: can\\'t set date: Operation not permitted\\nIf you want to allow the container to change the system time, you can add a capabil-\\nity called CAP_SYS_TIME to the containerâs capabilities list, as shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-add-settime-capability\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - name: main\\n    image: alpine\\nListing 13.11\\nAdding the CAP_SYS_TIME capability: pod-add-settime-capability.yaml\\n \\n',\n",

The effective group ID is 0(root), but group IDs 555, 666, and 777 are\\nalso associated with the user. \\n In the pod definition, you set fsGroup to 555. Because of this, the mounted volume\\nwill be owned by group ID 555, as shown here:\\n/ $ ls -l / | grep volume\\ndrwxrwsrwx    2 root     555              6 May 29 12:23 volume\\nIf you create a file in the mounted volumeâs directory, the file is owned by user ID\\n1111 (thatâs the user ID the container is running as) and by group ID 555:\\n/ $ echo foo > /volume/foo\\n/ $ ls -l /volume\\ntotal 4\\n-rw-r--r--    1 1111     555              4 May 29 12:25 foo\\nThis is different from how ownership is otherwise set up for newly created files. Usu-\\nally, the userâs effective group ID, which is 0 in your case, is used when a user creates\\nfiles.

Before running the following examples, ensure itâs enabled. If\\nyouâre using Minikube, refer to the next sidebar.\\nWhen someone posts a pod resource to the API server, the PodSecurityPolicy admis-\\nsion control plugin validates the pod definition against the configured PodSecurity-\\nPolicies. If the pod conforms to the clusterâs policies, itâs accepted and stored into\\netcd; otherwise itâs rejected immediately. The plugin may also modify the pod\\nresource according to defaults configured in the policy.\\nUNDERSTANDING WHAT A PODSECURITYPOLICY CAN DO\\nA PodSecurityPolicy resource defines things like the following:\\n\\uf0a1Whether a pod can use the hostâs IPC, PID, or Network namespaces\\n\\uf0a1Which host ports a pod can bind to\\n\\uf0a1What user IDs a container can run as\\n\\uf0a1Whether a pod with privileged containers can be created\\nEnabling RBAC and PodSecurityPolicy admission control in Minikube\\nIâm using Minikube version v0.19.0 to run these examples. That version doesnât\\nenable either the PodSecurityPolicy admission control plugin or RBAC authorization,\\nwhich is required in part of the exercises. One exercise also requires authenticating\\nas a different user, so youâll also need to enable the basic authentication plugin\\nwhere users are defined in a file.\\nTo run Minikube with all these plugins enabled, you may need to use this (or a similar)\\ncommand, depending on the version youâre using: \\n$ minikube start --extra-config apiserver.Authentication.PasswordFile.\\nâ¥ BasicAuthFile=/etc/kubernetes/passwd --extra-config=apiserver.\\nâ¥ Authorization.Mode=RBAC --extra-config=apiserver.GenericServerRun\\nâ¥ Options.AdmissionControl=NamespaceLifecycle,LimitRanger,Service\\nâ¥ Account,PersistentVolumeLabel,DefaultStorageClass,ResourceQuota,\\nâ¥ DefaultTolerationSeconds,PodSecurityPolicy\\nThe API server wonât start up until you create the password file you specified in the\\ncommand line options. This is how to create the file:\\n$ cat <<EOF | minikube ssh sudo tee /etc/kubernetes/passwd\\npassword,alice,1000,basic-user\\npassword,bob,2000,privileged-user\\nEOF\\nYouâll find a shell script that runs both commands in the bookâs code archive in\\nChapter13/minikube-with-rbac-and-psp-enabled.sh.\\n \\n',\n",

As the\\nname suggests, it prevents users from deploying containers that run as root. Either the\\ncontainer spec must specify a runAsUser field, which canât be zero (zero is the root\\nuserâs ID), or the container image itself must run as a non-zero user ID. We explained\\nwhy this is a good thing earlier.\\n13.3.3 Configuring allowed, default, and disallowed capabilities\\nAs you learned, containers can run in privileged mode or not, and you can define a\\nmore fine-grained permission configuration by adding or dropping Linux kernel\\ncapabilities in each container. Three fields influence which capabilities containers can\\nor cannot use:\\n\\uf0a1\\nallowedCapabilities\\n\\uf0a1\\ndefaultAddCapabilities\\n\\uf0a1\\nrequiredDropCapabilities\\nWeâll look at an example first, and then discuss what each of the three fields does.

Does that mean it always\\napplies across all namespaces? No, because that would make them relatively unus-\\nable. After all, system pods must often be allowed to do things that regular pods\\nshouldnât.\\n Assigning different policies to different users is done through the RBAC mecha-\\nnism described in the previous chapter. The idea is to create as many policies as you\\nneed and make them available to individual users or groups by creating ClusterRole\\nresources and pointing them to the individual policies by name. By binding those\\nClusterRoles to specific users or groups with ClusterRoleBindings, when the Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy Admission Control plugin needs to decide whether to admit a pod defi-\\nnition or not, it will only consider the policies accessible to the user creating the pod. \\n Youâll see how to do this in the next exercise. Youâll start by creating an additional\\nPodSecurityPolicy.\\nCREATING A PODSECURITYPOLICY ALLOWING PRIVILEGED CONTAINERS TO BE DEPLOYED\\nYouâll create a special PodSecurityPolicy that will allow privileged users to create pods\\nwith privileged containers.

Because youâre currently\\nlogged in as a cluster-admin, you can see all the policies. When creating pods, if any\\npolicy allows you to deploy a pod with certain features, the API server will accept\\nyour pod.\\n Now imagine two additional users are using your cluster: Alice and Bob. You want\\nAlice to only deploy restricted (non-privileged) pods, but you want to allow Bob to\\nalso deploy privileged pods. You do this by making sure Alice can only use the default\\nPodSecurityPolicy, while allowing Bob to use both.\\nUSING RBAC TO ASSIGN DIFFERENT PODSECURITYPOLICIES TO DIFFERENT USERS\\nIn the previous chapter, you used RBAC to grant users access to only certain resource\\ntypes, but I mentioned that access can be granted to specific resource instances by ref-\\nerencing them by name. Thatâs what youâll use to make users use different Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy resources.\\n First, youâll create two ClusterRoles, each allowing the use of one of the policies.\\nYouâll call the first one psp-default and in it allow the use of the default Pod-\\nSecurityPolicy resource. You can use kubectl create clusterrole to do that:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrole psp-default --verb=use \\nâ¥  --resource=podsecuritypolicies --resource-name=default\\nclusterrole \"psp-default\" created\\nNOTE\\nYouâre using the special verb use instead of get, list, watch, or similar.\\nAs you can see, youâre referring to a specific instance of a PodSecurityPolicy resource by\\nusing the --resource-name option. Now, create another ClusterRole called psp-\\nprivileged, pointing to the privileged policy:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrole psp-privileged --verb=use\\nâ¥  --resource=podsecuritypolicies --resource-name=privileged\\nclusterrole \"psp-privileged\" created\\nNow, you need to bind these two policies to users. As you may remember from the pre-\\nvious chapter, if youâre binding a ClusterRole that grants access to cluster-level\\nresources (which is what PodSecurityPolicy resources are), you need to use a Cluster-\\nRoleBinding instead of a (namespaced) RoleBinding. \\n Youâre going to bind the psp-default ClusterRole to all authenticated users, not\\nonly to Alice. This is necessary because otherwise no one could create any pods,\\nbecause the Admission Control plugin would complain that no policy is in place.\\nAuthenticated users all belong to the system:authenticated group, so youâll bind\\nthe ClusterRole to the group:\\n$ kubectl create clusterrolebinding psp-all-users \\nâ¥ --clusterrole=psp-default --group=system:authenticated\\nclusterrolebinding \"psp-all-users\" created\\n \\n',\n",

Turn to appendix A to find out more.

Youâve successfully used RBAC to make the Admission Control\\nplugin use different PodSecurityPolicy resources for different users.\\n13.4\\nIsolating the pod network\\nUp to now in this chapter, weâve explored many security-related configuration options\\nthat apply to individual pods and their containers. In the remainder of this chapter,\\nweâll look at how the network between pods can be secured by limiting which pods can\\ntalk to which pods.\\n Whether this is configurable or not depends on which container networking\\nplugin is used in the cluster. If the networking plugin supports it, you can configure\\nnetwork isolation by creating NetworkPolicy resources. \\n A NetworkPolicy applies to pods that match its label selector and specifies either\\nwhich sources can access the matched pods or which destinations can be accessed\\nfrom the matched pods. This is configured through ingress and egress rules, respec-\\ntively. Both types of rules can match only the pods that match a pod selector, all\\npods in a namespace whose labels match a namespace selector, or a network IP\\nblock specified using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation (for example,\\n192.168.1.0/24). \\n Weâll look at both ingress and egress rules and all three matching options.\\nNOTE\\nIngress rules in a NetworkPolicy have nothing to do with the Ingress\\nresource discussed in chapter 5.\\n13.4.1 Enabling network isolation in a namespace\\nBy default, pods in a given namespace can be accessed by anyone. First, youâll need\\nto change that. Youâll create a default-deny NetworkPolicy, which will prevent all\\nclients from connecting to any pod in your namespace.

Theyâre specified for each container individually, not for the pod as\\na whole. The podâs resource requests and limits are the sum of the requests and lim-\\nits of all its containers. \\n14.1.1 Creating pods with resource requests\\nLetâs look at an example pod manifest, which has the CPU and memory requests spec-\\nified for its single container, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: requests-pod\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: busybox\\n    command: [\"dd\", \"if=/dev/zero\", \"of=/dev/null\"]\\n    name: main              \\n    resources:              \\n      requests:             \\n        cpu: 200m          \\n        memory: 10Mi    \\nIn the pod manifest, your single container requires one-fifth of a CPU core (200 mil-\\nlicores) to run properly. Five such pods/containers can run sufficiently fast on a single\\nCPU core. \\n When you donât specify a request for CPU, youâre saying you donât care how much\\nCPU time the process running in your container is allotted. In the worst case, it may\\nnot get any CPU time at all (this happens when a heavy demand by other processes\\nexists on the CPU). Although this may be fine for low-priority batch jobs, which arenât\\ntime-critical, it obviously isnât appropriate for containers handling user requests.\\n In the pod spec, youâre also requesting 10 mebibytes of memory for the container.\\nBy doing that, youâre saying that you expect the processes running inside the con-\\ntainer to use at most 10 mebibytes of RAM. They might use less, but youâre not expect-\\ning them to use more than that in normal circumstances. Later in this chapter youâll\\nsee what happens if they do.\\n Now youâll run the pod. When the pod starts, you can take a quick look at the pro-\\ncessâ CPU consumption by running the top command inside the container, as shown\\nin the following listing.\\nListing 14.1\\nA pod with resource requests: requests-pod.yaml\\nYouâre specifying resource \\nrequests for the main container.\\nThe container requests 200 \\nmillicores (that is, 1/5 of a \\nsingle CPU coreâs time).\\nThe container also\\nrequests 10 mebibytes\\nof memory.\\n \\n',\n",

The Minikube VM,\\nwhich is where this example is running, has two CPU cores allotted to it. Thatâs why\\nthe process is shown consuming 50% of the whole CPU. \\n Fifty percent of two cores is obviously one whole core, which means the container\\nis using more than the 200 millicores you requested in the pod specification. This is\\nexpected, because requests donât limit the amount of CPU a container can use. Youâd\\nneed to specify a CPU limit to do that. Youâll try that later, but first, letâs see how spec-\\nifying resource requests in a pod affects the scheduling of the pod.\\n14.1.2 Understanding how resource requests affect scheduling\\nBy specifying resource requests, youâre specifying the minimum amount of resources\\nyour pod needs. This information is what the Scheduler uses when scheduling the pod\\nto a node. Each node has a certain amount of CPU and memory it can allocate to\\npods. When scheduling a pod, the Scheduler will only consider nodes with enough\\nunallocated resources to meet the podâs resource requirements. If the amount of\\nunallocated CPU or memory is less than what the pod requests, Kubernetes will not\\nschedule the pod to that node, because the node canât provide the minimum amount\\nrequired by the pod.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE SCHEDULER DETERMINES IF A POD CAN FIT ON A NODE\\nWhatâs important and somewhat surprising here is that the Scheduler doesnât look at\\nhow much of each individual resource is being used at the exact time of scheduling\\nbut at the sum of resources requested by the existing pods deployed on the node.\\nEven though existing pods may be using less than what theyâve requested, scheduling\\nanother pod based on actual resource consumption would break the guarantee given\\nto the already deployed pods.\\n This is visualized in figure 14.1. Three pods are deployed on the node. Together,\\ntheyâve requested 80% of the nodeâs CPU and 60% of the nodeâs memory. Pod D,\\nshown at the bottom right of the figure, cannot be scheduled onto the node because it\\nrequests 25% of the CPU, which is more than the 20% of unallocated CPU. The fact\\nthat the three pods are currently using only 70% of the CPU makes no difference.\\nListing 14.2\\nExamining CPU and memory usage from within a container\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '407\\nRequesting resources for a podâs containers\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW THE SCHEDULER USES PODSâ REQUESTS WHEN SELECTING THE BEST NODE \\nFOR A POD\\nYou may remember from chapter 11 that the Scheduler first filters the list of nodes to\\nexclude those that the pod canât fit on and then prioritizes the remaining nodes per the\\nconfigured prioritization functions. Among others, two prioritization functions rank\\nnodes based on the amount of resources requested: LeastRequestedPriority and\\nMostRequestedPriority. The first one prefers nodes with fewer requested resources\\n(with a greater amount of unallocated resources), whereas the second one is the exact\\noppositeâit prefers nodes that have the most requested resources (a smaller amount of\\nunallocated CPU and memory). But, as weâve discussed, they both consider the amount\\nof requested resources, not the amount of resources actually consumed.\\n The Scheduler is configured to use only one of those functions. You may wonder\\nwhy anyone would want to use the MostRequestedPriority function. After all, if you\\nhave a set of nodes, you usually want to spread CPU load evenly across them. However,\\nthatâs not the case when running on cloud infrastructure, where you can add and\\nremove nodes whenever necessary. By configuring the Scheduler to use the Most-\\nRequestedPriority function, you guarantee that Kubernetes will use the smallest pos-\\nsible number of nodes while still providing each pod with the amount of CPU/memory\\nit requests. By keeping pods tightly packed, certain nodes are left vacant and can be\\nremoved. Because youâre paying for individual nodes, this saves you money.\\nINSPECTING A NODEâS CAPACITY\\nLetâs see the Scheduler in action. Youâll deploy another pod with four times the\\namount of requested resources as before. But before you do that, letâs see your nodeâs\\ncapacity. Because the Scheduler needs to know how much CPU and memory each\\nnode has, the Kubelet reports this data to the API server, making it available through\\nPod C\\nNode\\nPod A\\nUnallocated\\nCPU requests\\nPod B\\nPod A\\nCurrently unused\\nCPU usage\\nPod B\\nPod C\\n0%\\n100%\\nPod A\\nMemory requests\\nPod B\\nPod C\\nPod A\\nMemory usage\\nPod B\\nPod C\\nCPU requests\\nMemory requests\\nUnallocated\\nCurrently unused\\nPod D\\nPod D cannot be scheduled; its CPU\\nrequests exceed unallocated CPU\\nFigure 14.1\\nThe Scheduler only cares about requests, not actual usage.\\n \\n',\n",

If you delete your second pod, the\\nScheduler will be notified of the deletion (through the watch mechanism described in\\nchapter 11) and will schedule your third pod as soon as the second pod terminates.\\nThis is shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl delete po requests-pod-2\\npod \"requests-pod-2\" deleted \\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME             READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE\\nrequests-pod     1/1       Running       0          2h\\nrequests-pod-2   1/1       Terminating   0          1h\\nrequests-pod-3   0/1       Pending       0          1h\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME             READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\nrequests-pod     1/1       Running   0          2h\\nrequests-pod-3   1/1       Running   0          1h\\nIn all these examples, youâve specified a request for memory, but it hasnât played any\\nrole in the scheduling because your node has more than enough allocatable memory to\\naccommodate all your podsâ requests. Both CPU and memory requests are treated the\\nsame way by the Scheduler, but in contrast to memory requests, a podâs CPU requests\\nalso play a role elsewhereâwhile the pod is running.

One has requested 200 millicores and the\\nother one five times as much. At the beginning of the chapter, we said Kubernetes dis-\\ntinguishes between resource requests and limits. You havenât defined any limits yet, so\\nthe two pods are in no way limited when it comes to how much CPU they can each\\nconsume. If the process inside each pod consumes as much CPU time as it can, how\\nmuch CPU time does each pod get? \\n The CPU requests donât only affect schedulingâthey also determine how the\\nremaining (unused) CPU time is distributed between pods. Because your first pod\\nrequested 200 millicores of CPU and the other one 1,000 millicores, any unused CPU\\nwill be split among the two pods in a 1 to 5 ratio, as shown in figure 14.2. If both pods\\nconsume as much CPU as they can, the first pod will get one sixth or 16.7% of the\\nCPU time and the other one the remaining five sixths or 83.3%.\\nBut if one container wants to use up as much CPU as it can, while the other one is sit-\\nting idle at a given moment, the first container will be allowed to use the whole CPU\\ntime (minus the small amount of time used by the second container, if any). After all,\\nit makes sense to use all the available CPU if no one else is using it, right? As soon as\\nthe second container needs CPU time, it will get it and the first container will be throt-\\ntled back.\\n14.1.4 Defining and requesting custom resources\\nKubernetes also allows you to add your own custom resources to a node and request\\nthem in the podâs resource requests.

       "  'text': '412\\nCHAPTER 14\\nManaging podsâ computational resources\\n First, you obviously need to make Kubernetes aware of your custom resource by\\nadding it to the Node objectâs capacity field. This can be done by performing a\\nPATCH HTTP request. The resource name can be anything, such as example.org/my-\\nresource, as long as it doesnât start with the kubernetes.io domain. The quantity\\nmust be an integer (for example, you canât set it to 100 millis, because 0.1 isnât an inte-\\nger; but you can set it to 1000m or 2000m or, simply, 1 or 2). The value will be copied\\nfrom the capacity to the allocatable field automatically.\\n Then, when creating pods, you specify the same resource name and the requested\\nquantity under the resources.requests field in the container spec or with --requests\\nwhen using kubectl run like you did in previous examples. The Scheduler will make\\nsure the pod is only deployed to a node that has the requested amount of the custom\\nresource available. Every deployed pod obviously reduces the number of allocatable\\nunits of the resource.\\n An example of a custom resource could be the number of GPU units available on the\\nnode. Pods requiring the use of a GPU specify that in their requests. The Scheduler then\\nmakes sure the pod is only scheduled to nodes with at least one GPU still unallocated.\\n14.2\\nLimiting resources available to a container\\nSetting resource requests for containers in a pod ensures each container gets the min-\\nimum amount of resources it needs. Now letâs see the other side of the coinâthe\\nmaximum amount the container will be allowed to consume. \\n14.2.1 Setting a hard limit for the amount of resources a container can use\\nWeâve seen how containers are allowed to use up all the CPU if all the other processes\\nare sitting idle. But you may want to prevent certain containers from using up more\\nthan a specific amount of CPU. And youâll always want to limit the amount of memory\\na container can consume. \\n CPU is a compressible resource, which means the amount used by a container can\\nbe throttled without affecting the process running in the container in an adverse way.\\nMemory is obviously differentâitâs incompressible. Once a process is given a chunk of\\nmemory, that memory canât be taken away from it until itâs released by the process\\nitself. Thatâs why you need to limit the maximum amount of memory a container can\\nbe given. \\n Without limiting memory, a container (or a pod) running on a worker node may\\neat up all the available memory and affect all other pods on the node and any new\\npods scheduled to the node (remember that new pods are scheduled to the node\\nbased on the memory requests and not actual memory usage). A single malfunction-\\ning or malicious pod can practically make the whole node unusable.\\nCREATING A POD WITH RESOURCE LIMITS\\nTo prevent this from happening, Kubernetes allows you to specify resource limits for\\nevery container (along with, and virtually in the same way as, resource requests). The\\nfollowing listing shows an example pod manifest with resource limits.\\n \\n',\n",

As youâve learned, a processâ CPU usage is throttled, so when a CPU\\nlimit is set for a container, the process isnât given more CPU time than the config-\\nured limit. \\n With memory, itâs different. When a process tries to allocate memory over its\\nlimit, the process is killed (itâs said the container is OOMKilled, where OOM stands\\nfor Out Of Memory). If the podâs restart policy is set to Always or OnFailure, the\\nprocess is restarted immediately, so you may not even notice it getting killed. But if it\\nkeeps going over the memory limit and getting killed, Kubernetes will begin restart-\\ning it with increasing delays between restarts. Youâll see a CrashLoopBackOff status\\nin that case:\\n$ kubectl get po\\nNAME        READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE\\nmemoryhog   0/1       CrashLoopBackOff   3          1m\\nThe CrashLoopBackOff status doesnât mean the Kubelet has given up. It means that\\nafter each crash, the Kubelet is increasing the time period before restarting the con-\\ntainer. After the first crash, it restarts the container immediately and then, if it crashes\\nagain, waits for 10 seconds before restarting it again. On subsequent crashes, this\\ndelay is then increased exponentially to 20, 40, 80, and 160 seconds, and finally lim-\\nited to 300 seconds. Once the interval hits the 300-second limit, the Kubelet keeps\\nrestarting the container indefinitely every five minutes until the pod either stops\\ncrashing or is deleted. \\n To examine why the container crashed, you can check the podâs log and/or use\\nthe kubectl describe pod command, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe pod\\nName:       memoryhog\\n...\\nContainers:\\n  main:\\n    ...\\n    State:          Terminated          \\n      Reason:       OOMKilled           \\n      Exit Code:    137\\n      Started:      Tue, 27 Dec 2016 14:55:53 +0100\\n      Finished:     Tue, 27 Dec 2016 14:55:58 +0100\\n    Last State:     Terminated            \\n      Reason:       OOMKilled             \\n      Exit Code:    137\\nListing 14.8\\nInspecting why a container terminated with kubectl describe pod\\nThe current container was \\nkilled because it was out \\nof memory (OOM).\\nThe previous container \\nwas also killed because \\nit was  OOM\\n \\n',\n",

Now, examine the output of the top command closely. Is there any-\\nthing that strikes you as odd?\\n Look at the amount of used and free memory. Those numbers are nowhere near\\nthe 20 MiB you set as the limit for the container. Similarly, you set the CPU limit to\\none core and it seems like the main process is using only 50% of the available CPU\\ntime, even though the dd command, when used like youâre using it, usually uses all the\\nCPU it has available. Whatâs going on?\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT CONTAINERS ALWAYS SEE THE NODEâS MEMORY, NOT THE CONTAINERâS\\nThe top command shows the memory amounts of the whole node the container is\\nrunning on.

In that case,\\nthe JVM will set the maximum heap size based on the hostâs total memory instead of\\nthe memory available to the container. When you run your containerized Java apps in\\na Kubernetes cluster on your laptop, the problem doesnât manifest itself, because the\\ndifference between the memory limits you set for the pod and the total memory avail-\\nable on your laptop is not that great. \\n But when you deploy your pod onto a production system, where nodes have much\\nmore physical memory, the JVM may go over the containerâs memory limit you config-\\nured and will be OOMKilled. \\n And if you think setting the -Xmx option properly solves the issue, youâre wrong,\\nunfortunately. The -Xmx option only constrains the heap size, but does nothing about\\nthe JVMâs off-heap memory. Luckily, new versions of Java alleviate that problem by tak-\\ning the configured container limits into account.\\nUNDERSTANDING THAT CONTAINERS ALSO SEE ALL THE NODEâS CPU CORES\\nExactly like with memory, containers will also see all the nodeâs CPUs, regardless of\\nthe CPU limits configured for the container. Setting a CPU limit to one core doesnât\\nmagically only expose only one CPU core to the container. All the CPU limit does is\\nconstrain the amount of CPU time the container can use. \\n A container with a one-core CPU limit running on a 64-core CPU will get 1/64th\\nof the overall CPU time. And even though its limit is set to one core, the containerâs\\nprocesses will not run on only one core. At different points in time, its code may be\\nexecuted on different cores.\\n Nothing is wrong with this, right? While thatâs generally the case, at least one sce-\\nnario exists where this situation is catastrophic.\\n Certain applications look up the number of CPUs on the system to decide how\\nmany worker threads they should run. Again, such an app will run fine on a develop-\\nment laptop, but when deployed on a node with a much bigger number of cores, itâs\\ngoing to spin up too many threads, all competing for the (possibly) limited CPU time.\\nAlso, each thread requires additional memory, causing the apps memory usage to sky-\\nrocket. \\n You may want to use the Downward API to pass the CPU limit to the container and\\nuse it instead of relying on the number of CPUs your app can see on the system. You\\ncan also tap into the cgroups system directly to get the configured CPU limit by read-\\ning the following files:\\n\\uf0a1/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us\\n\\uf0a1/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us\\n \\n',\n",

Which\\ncontainer should be killed? Should it be pod B, because its request for memory canât\\nbe satisfied, or should pod A be killed to free up memory, so it can be provided to\\npod B? \\n Obviously, it depends. Kubernetes canât make a proper decision on its own. You\\nneed a way to specify which pods have priority in such cases. Kubernetes does this by\\ncategorizing pods into three Quality of Service (QoS) classes:\\n\\uf0a1\\nBestEffort (the lowest priority)\\n\\uf0a1\\nBurstable\\n\\uf0a1\\nGuaranteed (the highest)\\n14.3.1 Defining the QoS class for a pod\\nYou might expect these classes to be assignable to pods through a separate field in the\\nmanifest, but they arenât. The QoS class is derived from the combination of resource\\nrequests and limits for the podâs containers. Hereâs how.\\nASSIGNING A POD TO THE BESTEFFORT CLASS\\nThe lowest priority QoS class is the BestEffort class. Itâs assigned to pods that donât\\nhave any requests or limits set at all (in any of their containers). This is the QoS class\\nthat has been assigned to all the pods you created in previous chapters. Containers\\nrunning in these pods have had no resource guarantees whatsoever. In the worst\\ncase, they may get almost no CPU time at all and will be the first ones killed when\\nmemory needs to be freed for other pods. But because a BestEffort pod has no\\nmemory limits set, its containers may use as much memory as they want, if enough\\nmemory is available.\\nASSIGNING A POD TO THE GUARANTEED CLASS\\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the Guaranteed QoS class. This class is given to\\npods whose containersâ requests are equal to the limits for all resources. For a podâs\\nclass to be Guaranteed, three things need to be true:\\n\\uf0a1Requests and limits need to be set for both CPU and memory.\\n\\uf0a1They need to be set for each container.\\n\\uf0a1They need to be equal (the limit needs to match the request for each resource\\nin each container).\\nBecause a containerâs resource requests, if not set explicitly, default to the limits,\\nspecifying the limits for all resources (for each container in the pod) is enough for\\n \\n',\n",

First in line to\\nget killed are pods in the BestEffort class, followed by Burstable pods, and finally\\nGuaranteed pods, which only get killed if system processes need memory.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW QOS CLASSES LINE UP\\nLetâs look at the example shown in figure 14.5. Imagine having two single-container\\npods, where the first one has the BestEffort QoS class, and the second oneâs is\\nBurstable. When the nodeâs whole memory is already maxed out and one of the pro-\\ncesses on the node tries to allocate more memory, the system will need to kill one of\\nthe processes (perhaps even the process trying to allocate additional memory) to\\nhonor the allocation request. In this case, the process running in the BestEffort pod\\nwill always be killed before the one in the Burstable pod.\\nObviously, a BestEffort podâs process will also be killed before any Guaranteed podsâ\\nprocesses are killed. Likewise, a Burstable podâs process will also be killed before that\\nof a Guaranteed pod. But what happens if there are only two Burstable pods? Clearly,\\nthe selection process needs to prefer one over the other.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS WITH THE SAME QOS CLASS ARE HANDLED\\nEach running process has an OutOfMemory (OOM) score. The system selects the\\nprocess to kill by comparing OOM scores of all the running processes. When memory\\nneeds to be freed, the process with the highest score gets killed.\\n OOM scores are calculated from two things: the percentage of the available mem-\\nory the process is consuming and a fixed OOM score adjustment, which is based on the\\npodâs QoS class and the containerâs requested memory. When two single-container pods\\nexist, both in the Burstable class, the system will kill the one using more of its requested\\nBestEffort\\nQoS pod\\nPod A\\nFirst in line\\nto be killed\\nActual usage\\nRequests\\nLimits\\nBurstable\\nQoS pod\\nPod B\\nSecond in line\\nto be killed\\n90% used\\nRequests\\nLimits\\nBurstable\\nQoS pod\\nPod C\\nThird in line\\nto be killed\\n70% used\\nRequests\\nLimits\\nGuaranteed\\nQoS pod\\nPod D\\nLast to\\nbe killed\\n99% used\\nRequests\\nLimits\\nFigure 14.5\\nWhich pods get killed first\\n \\n',\n",

Itâs a good idea to set requests and limits on\\nevery container.\\n14.4.1 Introducing the LimitRange resource\\nInstead of having to do this for every container, you can also do it by creating a Limit-\\nRange resource. It allows you to specify (for each namespace) not only the minimum\\nand maximum limit you can set on a container for each resource, but also the default\\nresource requests for containers that donât specify requests explicitly, as depicted in\\nfigure 14.6.\\nAPI server\\nValidation\\nPod A\\nmanifest\\n- Requests\\n- Limits\\nPod A\\nmanifest\\n- Requests\\n- Limits\\nPod B\\nmanifest\\n- No\\nrequests\\nor limits\\nPod B\\nmanifest\\n- No\\nrequests\\nor limits\\nDefaulting\\nRejected because\\nrequests and limits are\\noutside min/max values\\nDefaults\\napplied\\nNamespace XYZ\\nLimitRange\\nPod B\\nmanifest\\n- Default\\nrequests\\n- Default\\nlimits\\nPod B\\n- Default requests\\n- Default limits\\n- Min/max CPU\\n- Min/max memory\\n- Default requests\\n- Default limits\\nFigure 14.6\\nA LimitRange is used for validation and defaulting pods.\\n \\n',\n",

When a pod manifest is posted to the\\nAPI server, the LimitRanger plugin validates the pod spec. If validation fails, the mani-\\nfest is rejected immediately. Because of this, a great use-case for LimitRange objects is\\nto prevent users from creating pods that are bigger than any node in the cluster. With-\\nout such a LimitRange, the API server will gladly accept the pod, but then never\\nschedule it. \\n The limits specified in a LimitRange resource apply to each individual pod/con-\\ntainer or other kind of object created in the same namespace as the LimitRange\\nobject. They donât limit the total amount of resources available across all the pods in\\nthe namespace. This is specified through ResourceQuota objects, which are explained\\nin section 14.5. \\n14.4.2 Creating a LimitRange object\\nLetâs look at a full example of a LimitRange and see what the individual properties do.\\nThe following listing shows the full definition of a LimitRange resource.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: LimitRange\\nmetadata:\\n  name: example\\nspec:\\n  limits:\\n  - type: Pod           \\n    min:                         \\n      cpu: 50m                   \\n      memory: 5Mi                \\n    max:                          \\n      cpu: 1                      \\n      memory: 1Gi                 \\n  - type: Container             \\n    defaultRequest:             \\n      cpu: 100m                 \\n      memory: 10Mi              \\n    default:                      \\n      cpu: 200m                   \\n      memory: 100Mi               \\n    min:                         \\n      cpu: 50m                   \\n      memory: 5Mi                \\n    max:                         \\n      cpu: 1                     \\n      memory: 1Gi                \\n    maxLimitRequestRatio:         \\n      cpu: 4                      \\n      memory: 10                  \\nListing 14.10\\nA LimitRange resource: limits.yaml\\nSpecifies the \\nlimits for a pod \\nas a whole\\nMinimum CPU and memory all the \\npodâs containers can request in total\\nMaximum CPU and memory all the podâs \\ncontainers can request (and limit)\\nThe\\ncontainer\\nlimits are\\nspecified\\nbelow this\\nline.\\nDefault requests for CPU and memory \\nthat will be applied to containers that \\ndonât specify them explicitly\\nDefault limits for containers \\nthat donât specify them\\nMinimum and maximum \\nrequests/limits that a \\ncontainer can have\\nMaximum ratio between \\nthe limit and request \\nfor each resource\\n \\n',\n",

Limits from multiple LimitRange objects are all consolidated\\nwhen validating a pod or PVC.\\n Because the validation (and defaults) configured in a LimitRange object is per-\\nformed by the API server when it receives a new pod or PVC manifest, if you modify\\nthe limits afterwards, existing pods and PVCs will not be revalidatedâthe new limits\\nwill only apply to pods and PVCs created afterward. \\n14.4.3 Enforcing the limits\\nWith your limits in place, you can now try creating a pod that requests more CPU than\\nallowed by the LimitRange.

Creating the pod yields the following result:\\n$ kubectl create -f limits-pod-too-big.yaml \\nError from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"limits-pod-too-big.yaml\": \\npods \"too-big\" is forbidden: [\\n  maximum cpu usage per Pod is 1, but request is 2., \\n  maximum cpu usage per Container is 1, but request is 2.]\\nIâve modified the output slightly to make it more legible. The nice thing about the\\nerror message from the server is that it lists all the reasons why the pod was rejected,\\nnot only the first one it encountered. As you can see, the pod was rejected for two rea-\\nsons: you requested two CPUs for the container, but the maximum CPU limit for a\\ncontainer is one. Likewise, the pod as a whole requested two CPUs, but the maximum\\nis one CPU (if this was a multi-container pod, even if each individual container\\nrequested less than the maximum amount of CPU, together theyâd still need to\\nrequest less than two CPUs to pass the maximum CPU for pods). \\n14.4.4 Applying default resource requests and limits\\nNow letâs also see how default resource requests and limits are set on containers that\\ndonât specify them.

Itâs still possible to create many pods and eat up all the resources avail-\\nable in the cluster. LimitRanges donât provide any protection from that. A Resource-\\nQuota object, on the other hand, does. Youâll learn about them next.\\n14.5\\nLimiting the total resources available in a namespace\\nAs youâve seen, LimitRanges only apply to individual pods, but cluster admins also\\nneed a way to limit the total amount of resources available in a namespace. This is\\nachieved by creating a ResourceQuota object. \\n14.5.1 Introducing the ResourceQuota object\\nIn chapter 10 we said that several Admission Control plugins running inside the API\\nserver verify whether the pod may be created or not. In the previous section, I said\\nthat the LimitRanger plugin enforces the policies configured in LimitRange resources.\\nSimilarly, the ResourceQuota Admission Control plugin checks whether the pod\\nbeing created would cause the configured ResourceQuota to be exceeded. If thatâs\\nthe case, the podâs creation is rejected. Because resource quotas are enforced at pod\\ncreation time, a ResourceQuota object only affects pods created after the Resource-\\nQuota object is createdâcreating it has no effect on existing pods.\\n A ResourceQuota limits the amount of computational resources the pods and the\\namount of storage PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace can consume. It can also\\nlimit the number of pods, claims, and other API objects users are allowed to create\\ninside the namespace. Because youâve mostly dealt with CPU and memory so far, letâs\\nstart by looking at how to specify quotas for them.\\nCREATING A RESOURCEQUOTA FOR CPU AND MEMORY\\nThe overall CPU and memory all the pods in a namespace are allowed to consume is\\ndefined by creating a ResourceQuota object as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ResourceQuota\\nmetadata:\\n  name: cpu-and-mem\\nspec:\\n  hard:\\n    requests.cpu: 400m\\n    requests.memory: 200Mi\\n    limits.cpu: 600m\\n    limits.memory: 500Mi\\nListing 14.13\\nA ResourceQuota resource for CPU and memory: quota-cpu-memory.yaml\\n \\n',\n",

In your case, you have a LimitRange configured from the\\nprevious section, but if you didnât have one, you couldnât run the kubia-manual pod,\\nbecause it doesnât specify any resource requests or limits. Hereâs what would happen\\nin that case:\\n$ kubectl create -f ../Chapter03/kubia-manual.yaml\\nError from server (Forbidden): error when creating \"../Chapter03/kubia-\\nmanual.yaml\": pods \"kubia-manual\" is forbidden: failed quota: cpu-and-\\nmem: must specify limits.cpu,limits.memory,requests.cpu,requests.memory\\nWhen a quota for a specific resource (CPU or memory) is configured (request or\\nlimit), pods need to have the request or limit (respectively) set for that same resource;\\notherwise the API server will not accept the pod. Thatâs why having a LimitRange with\\ndefaults for those resources can make life a bit easier for people creating pods.\\n14.5.2 Specifying a quota for persistent storage\\nA ResourceQuota object can also limit the amount of persistent storage that can be\\nclaimed in the namespace, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ResourceQuota\\nmetadata:\\n  name: storage\\nspec:\\n  hard:\\n    requests.storage: 500Gi                               \\n    ssd.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage: 300Gi     \\n    standard.storageclass.storage.k8s.io/requests.storage: 1Ti\\nIn this example, the amount of storage all PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace\\ncan request is limited to 500 GiB (by the requests.storage entry in the Resource-\\nQuota object). But as youâll remember from chapter 6, PersistentVolumeClaims can\\nrequest a dynamically provisioned PersistentVolume of a specific StorageClass. Thatâs\\nwhy Kubernetes also makes it possible to define storage quotas for each StorageClass\\nindividually. The previous example limits the total amount of claimable SSD storage\\n(designated by the ssd StorageClass) to 300 GiB. The less-performant HDD storage\\n(StorageClass standard) is limited to 1 TiB.\\n14.5.3 Limiting the number of objects that can be created\\nA ResourceQuota can also be configured to limit the number of Pods, Replication-\\nControllers, Services, and other objects inside a single namespace.

       "  'text': '429\\nLimiting the total resources available in a namespace\\n14.5.4 Specifying quotas for specific pod states and/or QoS classes\\nThe quotas youâve created so far have applied to all pods, regardless of their current\\nstate and QoS class. But quotas can also be limited to a set of quota scopes. Four scopes are\\ncurrently available: BestEffort, NotBestEffort, Terminating, and NotTerminating. \\n The BestEffort and NotBestEffort scopes determine whether the quota applies\\nto pods with the BestEffort QoS class or with one of the other two classes (that is,\\nBurstable and Guaranteed). \\n The other two scopes (Terminating and NotTerminating) donât apply to pods\\nthat are (or arenât) in the process of shutting down, as the name might lead you to\\nbelieve. We havenât talked about this, but you can specify how long each pod is\\nallowed to run before itâs terminated and marked as Failed. This is done by setting\\nthe activeDeadlineSeconds field in the pod spec. This property defines the number\\nof seconds a pod is allowed to be active on the node relative to its start time before itâs\\nmarked as Failed and then terminated. The Terminating quota scope applies to pods\\nthat have the activeDeadlineSeconds set, whereas the NotTerminating applies to\\nthose that donât. \\n When creating a ResourceQuota, you can specify the scopes that it applies to. A\\npod must match all the specified scopes for the quota to apply to it. Additionally, what\\na quota can limit depends on the quotaâs scope. BestEffort scope can only limit the\\nnumber of pods, whereas the other three scopes can limit the number of pods,\\nCPU/memory requests, and CPU/memory limits. \\n If, for example, you want the quota to apply only to BestEffort, NotTerminating\\npods, you can create the ResourceQuota object shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: ResourceQuota\\nmetadata:\\n  name: besteffort-notterminating-pods\\nspec:\\n  scopes:                 \\n  - BestEffort            \\n  - NotTerminating        \\n  hard: \\n    pods: 4          \\nThis quota ensures that at most four pods exist with the BestEffort QoS class,\\nwhich donât have an active deadline. If the quota was targeting NotBestEffort pods\\ninstead, you could also specify requests.cpu, requests.memory, limits.cpu, and\\nlimits.memory.\\nNOTE\\nBefore you move on to the next section of this chapter, please delete\\nall the ResourceQuota and LimitRange resources you created. You wonât\\nListing 14.17\\nResourceQuota for BestEffort/NotTerminating pods: \\nquota-scoped.yaml\\nThis quota only applies to pods \\nthat have the BestEffort QoS and \\ndonât have an active deadline set.\\nOnly four such \\npods can exist.\\n \\n',\n",

If requests are set too high, your cluster nodes will be underuti-\\nlized and youâll be throwing money away. If you set them too low, your apps will be\\nCPU-starved or even killed by the OOM Killer. How do you find the sweet spot for\\nrequests and limits?\\n You find it by monitoring the actual resource usage of your containers under the\\nexpected load levels. Once the application is exposed to the public, you should keep\\nmonitoring it and adjust the resource requests and limits if required.\\n14.6.1 Collecting and retrieving actual resource usages\\nHow does one monitor apps running in Kubernetes? Luckily, the Kubelet itself\\nalready contains an agent called cAdvisor, which performs the basic collection of\\nresource consumption data for both individual containers running on the node and\\nthe node as a whole. Gathering those statistics centrally for the whole cluster requires\\nyou to run an additional component called Heapster. \\n Heapster runs as a pod on one of the nodes and is exposed through a regular\\nKubernetes Service, making it accessible at a stable IP address. It collects the data\\nfrom all cAdvisors in the cluster and exposes it in a single location.

Sometimes the top pod\\ncommand will refuse to show any metrics and instead print out an error like this:\\n$ kubectl top pod\\nW0312 22:12:58.021885   15126 top_pod.go:186] Metrics not available for pod \\ndefault/kubia-3773182134-63bmb, age: 1h24m19.021873823s\\nerror: Metrics not available for pod default/kubia-3773182134-63bmb, age: \\n1h24m19.021873823s\\nIf this happens, donât start looking for the cause of the error yet. Relax, wait a while,\\nand rerun the commandâit may take a few minutes, but the metrics should appear\\neventually. The kubectl top command gets the metrics from Heapster, which aggre-\\ngates the data over a few minutes and doesnât expose it immediately. \\nTIP\\nTo see resource usages across individual containers instead of pods, you\\ncan use the --containers option. \\n14.6.2 Storing and analyzing historical resource consumption statistics\\nThe top command only shows current resource usagesâit doesnât show you how\\nmuch CPU or memory your pods consumed throughout the last hour, yesterday, or a\\nweek ago, for example. In fact, both cAdvisor and Heapster only hold resource usage\\ndata for a short window of time. If you want to analyze your podsâ resource consump-\\ntion over longer time periods, youâll need to run additional tools.\\n When using Google Kubernetes Engine, you can monitor your cluster with Google\\nCloud Monitoring, but when youâre running your own local Kubernetes cluster\\n(either through Minikube or other means), people usually use InfluxDB for storing\\nstatistics data and Grafana for visualizing and analyzing them. \\nINTRODUCING INFLUXDB AND GRAFANA\\nInfluxDB is an open source time-series database ideal for storing application metrics\\nand other monitoring data. Grafana, also open source, is an analytics and visualization\\nsuite with a nice-looking web console that allows you to visualize the data stored in\\nInfluxDB and discover how your applicationâs resource usage behaves over time (an\\nexample showing three Grafana charts is shown in figure 14.9).\\n \\n \\n',\n",

On the\\nright-hand side, youâll see a list of dashboards containing two entries:\\n\\uf0a1Cluster\\n\\uf0a1Pods\\nTo see the resource usage statistics of the nodes, open the Cluster dashboard. There\\nyouâll see several charts showing the overall cluster usage, usage by node, and the\\nindividual usage for CPU, memory, network, and filesystem. The charts will not only\\nshow the actual usage, but also the requests and limits for those resources (where\\nthey apply).\\n If you then switch over to the Pods dashboard, you can examine the resource\\nusages for each individual pod, again with both requests and limits shown alongside\\nthe actual usage. \\n Initially, the charts show the statistics for the last 30 minutes, but you can zoom out\\nand see the data for much longer time periods: days, months, or even years.\\nUSING THE INFORMATION SHOWN IN THE CHARTS\\nBy looking at the charts, you can quickly see if the resource requests or limits youâve\\nset for your pods need to be raised or whether they can be lowered to allow more pods\\nto fit on your nodes. Letâs look at an example. Figure 14.10 shows the CPU and mem-\\nory charts for a pod.\\n At the far right of the top chart, you can see the pod is using more CPU than was\\nrequested in the podâs manifest. Although this isnât problematic when this is the only\\npod running on the node, you should keep in mind that a pod is only guaranteed as\\nmuch of a resource as it requests through resource requests. Your pod may be running\\nfine now, but when other pods are deployed to the same node and start using the\\nCPU, your podâs CPU time may be throttled. Because of this, to ensure the pod can\\nuse as much CPU as it needs to at any time, you should raise the CPU resource request\\nfor the podâs container.\\n The bottom chart shows the podâs memory usage and request. Here the situation is\\nthe exact opposite. The amount of memory the pod is using is well below what was\\nrequested in the podâs spec. The requested memory is reserved for the pod and wonât\\nbe available to other pods. The unused memory is therefore wasted. You should\\ndecrease the podâs memory request to make the memory available to other pods run-\\nning on the node. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '438\\nCHAPTER 15\\nAutomatic scaling of pods and cluster nodes\\n Luckily, Kubernetes can monitor your pods and scale them up automatically as\\nsoon as it detects an increase in the CPU usage or some other metric. If running on a\\ncloud infrastructure, it can even spin up additional nodes if the existing ones canât\\naccept any more pods. This chapter will explain how to get Kubernetes to do both pod\\nand node autoscaling.\\n The autoscaling feature in Kubernetes was completely rewritten between the 1.6\\nand the 1.7 version, so be aware you may find outdated information on this subject\\nonline.\\n15.1\\nHorizontal pod autoscaling\\nHorizontal pod autoscaling is the automatic scaling of the number of pod replicas man-\\naged by a controller. Itâs performed by the Horizontal controller, which is enabled and\\nconfigured by creating a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) resource. The controller\\nperiodically checks pod metrics, calculates the number of replicas required to meet\\nthe target metric value configured in the HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource, and\\nadjusts the replicas field on the target resource (Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication-\\nController, or StatefulSet). \\n15.1.1 Understanding the autoscaling process\\nThe autoscaling process can be split into three steps:\\n\\uf0a1Obtain metrics of all the pods managed by the scaled resource object.\\n\\uf0a1Calculate the number of pods required to bring the metrics to (or close to) the\\nspecified target value.\\n\\uf0a1Update the replicas field of the scaled resource.\\nLetâs examine all three steps next.\\nOBTAINING POD METRICS\\nThe Autoscaler doesnât perform the gathering of the pod metrics itself. It gets the\\nmetrics from a different source. As we saw in the previous chapter, pod and node met-\\nrics are collected by an agent called cAdvisor, which runs in the Kubelet on each node,\\nand then aggregated by the cluster-wide component called Heapster. The horizontal\\npod autoscaler controller gets the metrics of all the pods by querying Heapster\\nthrough REST calls. The flow of metrics data is shown in figure 15.1 (although all the\\nconnections are initiated in the opposite direction).\\nThis implies that Heapster must be running in the cluster for autoscaling to work. If\\nyouâre using Minikube and were following along in the previous chapter, Heapster\\nPod(s)\\ncAdvisor(s)\\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaler(s)\\nHeapster\\nFigure 15.1\\nFlow of metrics from the pod(s) to the HorizontalPodAutoscaler(s)\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '439\\nHorizontal pod autoscaling\\nshould already be enabled in your cluster. If not, make sure to enable the Heapster\\nadd-on before trying out any autoscaling examples.\\n Although you donât need to query Heapster directly, if youâre interested in doing\\nso, youâll find both the Heapster Pod and the Service itâs exposed through in the\\nkube-system namespace. \\nCALCULATING THE REQUIRED NUMBER OF PODS\\nOnce the Autoscaler has metrics for all the pods belonging to the resource the Auto-\\nscaler is scaling (the Deployment, ReplicaSet, ReplicationController, or StatefulSet\\nresource), it can use those metrics to figure out the required number of replicas. It\\nneeds to find the number that will bring the average value of the metric across all\\nthose replicas as close to the configured target value as possible. The input to this cal-\\nculation is a set of pod metrics (possibly multiple metrics per pod) and the output is a\\nsingle integer (the number of pod replicas). \\n When the Autoscaler is configured to consider only a single metric, calculating the\\nrequired replica count is simple. All it takes is summing up the metrics values of all\\nthe pods, dividing that by the target value set on the HorizontalPodAutoscaler\\nresource, and then rounding it up to the next-larger integer. The actual calculation is\\na bit more involved than this, because it also makes sure the Autoscaler doesnât thrash\\naround when the metric value is unstable and changes rapidly. \\n When autoscaling is based on multiple pod metrics (for example, both CPU usage\\nand Queries-Per-Second [QPS]), the calculation isnât that much more complicated.\\nThe Autoscaler calculates the replica count for each metric individually and then\\ntakes the highest value (for example, if four pods are required to achieve the target\\nCPU usage, and three pods are required to achieve the target QPS, the Autoscaler will\\nscale to four pods). Figure 15.2 shows this example.\\nA look at changes related to how the Autoscaler obtains metrics\\nPrior to Kubernetes version 1.6, the HorizontalPodAutoscaler obtained the metrics\\nfrom Heapster directly. In version 1.8, the Autoscaler can get the metrics through an\\naggregated version of the resource metrics API by starting the Controller Manager\\nwith the --horizontal-pod-autoscaler-use-rest-clients=true flag. From ver-\\nsion 1.9, this behavior will be enabled by default.\\nThe core API server will not expose the metrics itself. From version 1.7, Kubernetes\\nallows registering multiple API servers and making them appear as a single API\\nserver. This allows it to expose metrics through one of those underlying API servers.\\nWeâll explain API server aggregation in the last chapter. \\nSelecting what metrics collector to use in their clusters will be up to cluster adminis-\\ntrators. A simple translation layer is usually required to expose the metrics in the\\nappropriate API paths and in the appropriate format.\\n \\n',\n",

Theyâre shown in figure 15.4.\\nThe arrows leading from the pods to the cAdvisors, which continue on to Heapster\\nand finally to the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, indicate the direction of the flow of met-\\nrics data. Itâs important to be aware that each component gets the metrics from the\\nother components periodically (that is, cAdvisor gets the metrics from the pods in a\\ncontinuous loop; the same is also true for Heapster and for the HPA controller). The\\nend effect is that it takes quite a while for the metrics data to be propagated and a res-\\ncaling action to be performed. It isnât immediate. Keep this in mind when you observe\\nthe Autoscaler in action next.\\n15.1.2 Scaling based on CPU utilization\\nPerhaps the most important metric youâll want to base autoscaling on is the amount of\\nCPU consumed by the processes running inside your pods. Imagine having a few pods\\nproviding a service. When their CPU usage reaches 100% itâs obvious they canât cope\\nwith the demand anymore and need to be scaled either up (vertical scalingâincreas-\\ning the amount of CPU the pods can use) or out (horizontal scalingâincreasing the\\nnumber of pods).

       "  'text': '442\\nCHAPTER 15\\nAutomatic scaling of pods and cluster nodes\\nweâre only focusing on scaling out (increasing the number of pods). By doing that,\\nthe average CPU usage should come down. \\n Because CPU usage is usually unstable, it makes sense to scale out even before the\\nCPU is completely swampedâperhaps when the average CPU load across the pods\\nreaches or exceeds 80%. But 80% of what, exactly?\\nTIP\\nAlways set the target CPU usage well below 100% (and definitely never\\nabove 90%) to leave enough room for handling sudden load spikes.\\nAs you may remember from the previous chapter, the process running inside a con-\\ntainer is guaranteed the amount of CPU requested through the resource requests\\nspecified for the container. But at times when no other processes need CPU, the pro-\\ncess may use all the available CPU on the node. When someone says a pod is consum-\\ning 80% of the CPU, itâs not clear if they mean 80% of the nodeâs CPU, 80% of the\\npodâs guaranteed CPU (the resource request), or 80% of the hard limit configured\\nfor the pod through resource limits. \\n As far as the Autoscaler is concerned, only the podâs guaranteed CPU amount (the\\nCPU requests) is important when determining the CPU utilization of a pod. The Auto-\\nscaler compares the podâs actual CPU consumption and its CPU requests, which\\nmeans the pods youâre autoscaling need to have CPU requests set (either directly or\\nindirectly through a LimitRange object) for the Autoscaler to determine the CPU uti-\\nlization percentage.\\nCREATING A HORIZONTALPODAUTOSCALER BASED ON CPU USAGE\\nLetâs see how to create a HorizontalPodAutoscaler now and configure it to scale pods\\nbased on their CPU utilization. Youâll create a Deployment similar to the one in chap-\\nter 9, but as weâve discussed, youâll need to make sure the pods created by the Deploy-\\nment all have the CPU resource requests specified in order to make autoscaling\\npossible. Youâll have to add a CPU resource request to the Deploymentâs pod tem-\\nplate, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia\\nspec:\\n  replicas: 3                \\n  template:\\n    metadata:\\n      name: kubia\\n      labels:\\n        app: kubia\\n    spec:\\n      containers:\\n      - image: luksa/kubia:v1     \\n        name: nodejs\\nListing 15.1\\nDeployment with CPU requests set: deployment.yaml\\nManually setting the \\n(initial) desired number \\nof replicas to three\\nRunning the \\nkubia:v1 image\\n \\n',\n",

Youâve seen the -it\\noption a few times when running the kubectl exec command. As you can see, it can\\nalso be used with kubectl run. It allows you to attach the console to the process,\\nwhich will not only show you the processâ output directly, but will also terminate the\\nprocess as soon as you press CTRL+C. The --rm option causes the pod to be deleted\\nafterward, and the --restart=Never option causes kubectl run to create an unman-\\naged pod directly instead of through a Deployment object, which you donât need.\\nThis combination of options is useful for running commands inside the cluster with-\\nout having to piggyback on an existing pod. It not only behaves the same as if you\\nwere running the command locally, it even cleans up everything when the command\\nterminates. \\nSEEING THE AUTOSCALER SCALE UP THE DEPLOYMENT\\nAs the load-generator pod runs, youâll see it initially hitting the single pod. As before,\\nit takes time for the metrics to be updated, but when they are, youâll see the autoscaler\\nincrease the number of replicas. In my case, the podâs CPU utilization initially jumped\\nto 108%, which caused the autoscaler to increase the number of pods to four. The\\nutilization on the individual pods then decreased to 74% and then stabilized at\\naround 26%. \\nNOTE\\nIf the CPU load in your case doesnât exceed 30%, try running addi-\\ntional load-generators.\\nAgain, you can inspect autoscaler events with kubectl describe to see what the\\nautoscaler has done (only the most important information is shown in the following\\nlisting).\\nFrom    Reason              Message\\n----    ------              -------\\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 1; reason: All metrics below target\\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 4; reason: cpu resource utilization \\n                            (percentage of request) above target\\nDoes it strike you as odd that the initial average CPU utilization in my case, when I\\nonly had one pod, was 108%, which is more than 100%? Remember, a containerâs\\nCPU utilization is the containerâs actual CPU usage divided by its requested CPU. The\\nrequested CPU defines the minimum, not maximum amount of CPU available to the\\ncontainer, so a container may consume more than the requested CPU, bringing the\\npercentage over 100. \\n Before we go on, letâs do a little math and see how the autoscaler concluded that\\nfour replicas are needed.

If the autoscaler scales up to four pods, their average CPU utilization is\\nexpected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 27%, which is close to the target\\nvalue of 30% and almost exactly what the observed CPU utilization was.\\nUNDERSTANDING THE MAXIMUM RATE OF SCALING\\nIn my case, the CPU usage shot up to 108%, but in general, the initial CPU usage\\ncould spike even higher. Even if the initial average CPU utilization was higher (say\\n150%), requiring five replicas to achieve the 30% target, the autoscaler would still\\nonly scale up to four pods in the first step, because it has a limit on how many repli-\\ncas can be added in a single scale-up operation. The autoscaler will at most double\\nthe number of replicas in a single operation, if more than two current replicas\\nexist. If only one or two exist, it will scale up to a maximum of four replicas in a sin-\\ngle step. \\n Additionally, it has a limit on how soon a subsequent autoscale operation can\\noccur after the previous one. Currently, a scale-up will occur only if no rescaling\\nevent occurred in the last three minutes. A scale-down event is performed even less\\nfrequentlyâevery five minutes. Keep this in mind so you donât wonder why the\\nautoscaler refuses to perform a rescale operation even if the metrics clearly show\\nthat it should.\\nMODIFYING THE TARGET METRIC VALUE ON AN EXISTING HPA OBJECT\\nTo wrap up this section, letâs do one last exercise. Maybe your initial CPU utilization\\ntarget of 30% was a bit too low, so increase it to 60%. You do this by editing the HPA\\nresource with the kubectl edit command. When the text editor opens, change the\\ntargetAverageUtilization field to 60, as shown in the following listing.\\n...\\nspec:\\n  maxReplicas: 5\\n  metrics:\\n  - resource:\\n      name: cpu\\n      targetAverageUtilization: 60    \\n    type: Resource\\n...\\nAs with most other resources, after you modify the resource, your changes will be\\ndetected by the autoscaler controller and acted upon. You could also delete the\\nresource and recreate it with different target values, because by deleting the HPA\\nresource, you only disable autoscaling of the target resource (a Deployment in this\\ncase) and leave it at the scale it is at that time. The automatic scaling will resume after\\nyou create a new HPA resource for the Deployment.\\nListing 15.6\\nIncreasing the target CPU utilization by editing the HPA resource\\nChange this \\nfrom 30 to 60.\\n \\n',\n",

But what about autoscaling based on the podsâ memory\\nusage? \\n Memory-based autoscaling is much more problematic than CPU-based autoscal-\\ning. The main reason is because after scaling up, the old pods would somehow need to\\nbe forced to release memory. This needs to be done by the app itselfâit canât be done\\nby the system. All the system could do is kill and restart the app, hoping it would use\\nless memory than before. But if the app then uses the same amount as before, the\\nAutoscaler would scale it up again. And again, and again, until it reaches the maxi-\\nmum number of pods configured on the HPA resource. Obviously, this isnât what any-\\none wants. Memory-based autoscaling was introduced in Kubernetes version 1.8, and\\nis configured exactly like CPU-based autoscaling. Exploring it is left up to the reader.\\n15.1.4 Scaling based on other and custom metrics\\nYouâve seen how easy it is to scale pods based on their CPU usage. Initially, this was the\\nonly autoscaling option that was usable in practice. To have the autoscaler use custom,\\napp-defined metrics to drive its autoscaling decisions was fairly complicated. The ini-\\ntial design of the autoscaler didnât make it easy to move beyond simple CPU-based\\nscaling. This prompted the Kubernetes Autoscaling Special Interest Group (SIG) to\\nredesign the autoscaler completely. \\n If youâre interested in learning how complicated it was to use the initial autoscaler\\nwith custom metrics, I invite you to read my blog post entitled âKubernetes autoscal-\\ning based on custom metrics without using a host port,â which youâll find online at\\nhttp:/\\n/medium.com/@marko.luksa. Youâll learn about all the other problems I\\nencountered when trying to set up autoscaling based on custom metrics. Luckily,\\nnewer versions of Kubernetes donât have those problems. Iâll cover the subject in a\\nnew blog post. \\n Instead of going through a complete example here, letâs quickly go over how to\\nconfigure the autoscaler to use different metrics sources. Weâll start by examining how\\nwe defined what metric to use in our previous example. The following listing shows\\nhow your previous HPA object was configured to use the CPU usage metric.\\n...\\nspec:\\n  maxReplicas: 5\\n  metrics:\\n  - type: Resource      \\n    resource:\\n      name: cpu                      \\n      targetAverageUtilization: 30    \\n...\\nListing 15.7\\nHorizontalPodAutoscaler definition for CPU-based autoscaling\\nDefines the type \\nof metric\\nThe resource, whose \\nutilization will be monitored\\nThe target utilization \\nof this resource\\n \\n',\n",

The horizontal pod\\nautoscaler will monitor the Ingressâ metric and if it rises too far above the target value,\\nthe autoscaler will scale the kubia Deployment resource. \\n15.1.5 Determining which metrics are appropriate for autoscaling\\nYou need to understand that not all metrics are appropriate for use as the basis of\\nautoscaling. As mentioned previously, the podsâ containersâ memory consumption isnât\\na good metric for autoscaling. The autoscaler wonât function properly if increasing\\nthe number of replicas doesnât result in a linear decrease of the average value of the\\nobserved metric (or at least close to linear). \\n For example, if you have only a single pod instance and the value of the metric is X\\nand the autoscaler scales up to two replicas, the metric needs to fall to somewhere\\nclose to X/2. An example of such a custom metric is Queries per Second (QPS),\\nwhich in the case of web applications reports the number of requests the application\\nis receiving per second. Increasing the number of replicas will always result in a pro-\\nportionate decrease of QPS, because a greater number of pods will be handling the\\nsame total number of requests. \\n Before you decide to base the autoscaler on your appâs own custom metric, be sure\\nto think about how its value will behave when the number of pods increases or\\ndecreases.\\n15.1.6 Scaling down to zero replicas\\nThe horizontal pod autoscaler currently doesnât allow setting the minReplicas field\\nto 0, so the autoscaler will never scale down to zero, even if the pods arenât doing\\nListing 15.9\\nReferring to a metric of a different object in the HPA\\nUse metric of a \\nspecific object\\nThe name of \\nthe metric\\nThe specific object whose metric \\nthe autoscaler should obtain\\nThe\\nAutoscaler\\nshould\\nscale so\\nthe value\\nof the\\nmetric\\nstays close\\nto this.\\nThe scalable resource the \\nautoscaler will scale\\n \\n',\n",

When you run services that get requests only\\nonce every few hours or even days, it doesnât make sense to have them running all the\\ntime, eating up resources that could be used by other pods. But you still want to have\\nthose services available immediately when a client request comes in. \\n This is known as idling and un-idling. It allows pods that provide a certain service\\nto be scaled down to zero. When a new request comes in, the request is blocked until\\nthe pod is brought up and then the request is finally forwarded to the pod. \\n Kubernetes currently doesnât provide this feature yet, but it will eventually. Check\\nthe documentation to see if idling has been implemented yet. \\n15.2\\nVertical pod autoscaling\\nHorizontal scaling is great, but not every application can be scaled horizontally. For\\nsuch applications, the only option is to scale them verticallyâgive them more CPU\\nand/or memory. Because a node usually has more resources than a single pod\\nrequests, it should almost always be possible to scale a pod vertically, right? \\n Because a podâs resource requests are configured through fields in the pod\\nmanifest, vertically scaling a pod would be performed by changing those fields. I\\nsay âwouldâ because itâs currently not possible to change either resource requests\\nor limits of existing pods. Before I started writing the book (well over a year ago), I\\nwas sure that by the time I wrote this chapter, Kubernetes would already support\\nproper vertical pod autoscaling, so I included it in my proposal for the table of con-\\ntents. Sadly, what seems like a lifetime later, vertical pod autoscaling is still not\\navailable yet. \\n15.2.1 Automatically configuring resource requests\\nAn experimental feature sets the CPU and memory requests on newly created pods, if\\ntheir containers donât have them set explicitly. The feature is provided by an Admission\\nControl plugin called InitialResources. When a new pod without resource requests is\\ncreated, the plugin looks at historical resource usage data of the podâs containers (per\\nthe underlying container image and tag) and sets the requests accordingly. \\n You can deploy pods without specifying resource requests and rely on Kubernetes\\nto eventually figure out what each containerâs resource needs are. Effectively, Kuber-\\nnetes is vertically scaling the pod. For example, if a container keeps running out of\\nmemory, the next time a pod with that container image is created, its resource request\\nfor memory will be set higher automatically.\\n15.2.2 Modifying resource requests while a pod is running\\nEventually, the same mechanism will be used to modify an existing podâs resource\\nrequests, which means it will vertically scale the pod while itâs running. As Iâm writing\\nthis, a new vertical pod autoscaling proposal is being finalized. Please refer to the\\n \\n',\n",

But what about when all your nodes are at capacity and canât run any\\nmore pods? Obviously, this problem isnât limited only to when new pod instances are\\ncreated by the Autoscaler. Even when creating pods manually, you may encounter the\\nproblem where none of the nodes can accept the new pods, because the nodeâs\\nresources are used up by existing pods. \\n In that case, youâd need to delete several of those existing pods, scale them down\\nvertically, or add additional nodes to your cluster. If your Kubernetes cluster is run-\\nning on premises, youâd need to physically add a new machine and make it part of the\\nKubernetes cluster. But if your cluster is running on a cloud infrastructure, adding\\nadditional nodes is usually a matter of a few clicks or an API call to the cloud infra-\\nstructure. This can be done automatically, right?\\n Kubernetes includes the feature to automatically request additional nodes from\\nthe cloud provider as soon as it detects additional nodes are needed. This is per-\\nformed by the Cluster Autoscaler.\\n15.3.1 Introducing the Cluster Autoscaler\\nThe Cluster Autoscaler takes care of automatically provisioning additional nodes\\nwhen it notices a pod that canât be scheduled to existing nodes because of a lack of\\nresources on those nodes. It also de-provisions nodes when theyâre underutilized for\\nlonger periods of time. \\nREQUESTING ADDITIONAL NODES FROM THE CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE\\nA new node will be provisioned if, after a new pod is created, the Scheduler canât\\nschedule it to any of the existing nodes. The Cluster Autoscaler looks out for such\\npods and asks the cloud provider to start up an additional node. But before doing\\nthat, it checks whether the new node can even accommodate the pod. After all, if\\nthatâs not the case, it makes no sense to start up such a node.\\n Cloud providers usually group nodes into groups (or pools) of same-sized nodes\\n(or nodes having the same features). The Cluster Autoscaler thus canât simply say\\nâGive me an additional node.â It needs to also specify the node type.\\n The Cluster Autoscaler does this by examining the available node groups to see if\\nat least one node type would be able to fit the unscheduled pod. If exactly one such\\nnode group exists, the Autoscaler can increase the size of the node group to have the\\ncloud provider add another node to the group. If more than one option is available,\\nthe Autoscaler must pick the best one. The exact meaning of âbestâ will obviously\\nneed to be configurable. In the worst case, it selects a random one. A simple overview\\nof how the cluster Autoscaler reacts to an unschedulable pod is shown in figure 15.5.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '455\\nHorizontal scaling of cluster nodes\\n Certain services require that a minimum number of pods always keeps running;\\nthis is especially true for quorum-based clustered applications. For this reason, Kuber-\\nnetes provides a way of specifying the minimum number of pods that need to keep\\nrunning while performing these types of operations. This is done by creating a Pod-\\nDisruptionBudget resource.\\n Even though the name of the resource sounds complex, itâs one of the simplest\\nKubernetes resources available. It contains only a pod label selector and a number\\nspecifying the minimum number of pods that must always be available or, starting\\nfrom Kubernetes version 1.7, the maximum number of pods that can be unavailable.\\nWeâll look at what a PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) resource manifest looks like, but\\ninstead of creating it from a YAML file, youâll create it with kubectl create pod-\\ndisruptionbudget and then obtain and examine the YAML later.\\n If you want to ensure three instances of your kubia pod are always running (they\\nhave the label app=kubia), create the PodDisruptionBudget resource like this:\\n$ kubectl create pdb kubia-pdb --selector=app=kubia --min-available=3\\npoddisruptionbudget \"kubia-pdb\" created\\nSimple, right? Now, retrieve the PDBâs YAML. Itâs shown in the next listing.\\n$ kubectl get pdb kubia-pdb -o yaml\\napiVersion: policy/v1beta1\\nkind: PodDisruptionBudget\\nmetadata:\\n  name: kubia-pdb\\nspec:\\n  minAvailable: 3         \\n  selector:                \\n    matchLabels:           \\n      app: kubia           \\nstatus:\\n  ...\\nYou can also use a percentage instead of an absolute number in the minAvailable\\nfield. For example, you could state that 60% of all pods with the app=kubia label need\\nto be running at all times.\\nNOTE\\nStarting with Kubernetes 1.7, the PodDisruptionBudget resource also\\nsupports the maxUnavailable field, which you can use instead of min-\\nAvailable if you want to block evictions when more than that many pods are\\nunavailable. \\nWe donât have much more to say about this resource. As long as it exists, both the\\nCluster Autoscaler and the kubectl drain command will adhere to it and will never\\nevict a pod with the app=kubia label if that would bring the number of such pods\\nbelow three. \\nListing 15.10\\nA PodDisruptionBudget definition\\nHow many pods should \\nalways be available\\nThe label selector that \\ndetermines which pods \\nthis budget applies to\\n \\n',\n",

A pod can only be scheduled to a node if it toler-\\nates the nodeâs taints.\\n This is somewhat different from using node selectors and node affinity, which\\nyouâll learn about later in this chapter. Node selectors and node affinity rules make\\nit possible to select which nodes a pod can or canât be scheduled to by specifically\\nadding that information to the pod, whereas taints allow rejecting deployment of\\npods to certain nodes by only adding taints to the node without having to modify\\nexisting pods. Pods that you want deployed on a tainted node need to opt in to use\\nthe node, whereas with node selectors, pods explicitly specify which node(s) they\\nwant to be deployed to.\\n16.1.1 Introducing taints and tolerations\\nThe best path to learn about node taints is to see an existing taint. Appendix B shows\\nhow to set up a multi-node cluster with the kubeadm tool. By default, the master node\\nin such a cluster is tainted, so only Control Plane pods can be deployed on it. \\nDISPLAYING A NODEâS TAINTS\\nYou can see the nodeâs taints using kubectl describe node, as shown in the follow-\\ning listing.\\n$ kubectl describe node master.k8s\\nName:         master.k8s\\nRole:\\nLabels:       beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\\n              beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\\n              kubernetes.io/hostname=master.k8s\\n              node-role.kubernetes.io/master=\\nAnnotations:  node.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl=0\\n              volumes.kubernetes.io/controller-managed-attach-detach=true\\nTaints:       node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule      \\n...\\nThe master node has a single taint. Taints have a key, value, and an effect, and are repre-\\nsented as <key>=<value>:<effect>. The master nodeâs taint shown in the previous\\nlisting has the key node-role.kubernetes.io/master, a null value (not shown in the\\ntaint), and the effect of NoSchedule. \\n This taint prevents pods from being scheduled to the master node, unless those pods\\ntolerate this taint.

To make sure the kube-proxy pod\\nalso runs on the master node, it includes the appropriate toleration.

Those two tolerations refer to the NoExecute\\ninstead of the NoSchedule effect. \\n Each taint has an effect associated with it. Three possible effects exist:\\n\\uf0a1\\nNoSchedule, which means pods wonât be scheduled to the node if they donât tol-\\nerate the taint.\\n\\uf0a1\\nPreferNoSchedule is a soft version of NoSchedule, meaning the scheduler will\\ntry to avoid scheduling the pod to the node, but will schedule it to the node if it\\ncanât schedule it somewhere else. \\n\\uf0a1\\nNoExecute, unlike NoSchedule and PreferNoSchedule that only affect schedul-\\ning, also affects pods already running on the node. If you add a NoExecute taint\\nto a node, pods that are already running on that node and donât tolerate the\\nNoExecute taint will be evicted from the node. \\n16.1.2 Adding custom taints to a node\\nImagine having a single Kubernetes cluster where you run both production and non-\\nproduction workloads. Itâs of the utmost importance that non-production pods never\\nrun on the production nodes. This can be achieved by adding a taint to your produc-\\ntion nodes. To add a taint, you use the kubectl taint command:\\n$ kubectl taint node node1.k8s node-type=production:NoSchedule\\nnode \"node1.k8s\" tainted\\nThis adds a taint with key node-type, value production and the NoSchedule effect. If\\nyou now deploy multiple replicas of a regular pod, youâll see none of them are sched-\\nuled to the node you tainted, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl run test --image busybox --replicas 5 -- sleep 99999\\ndeployment \"test\" created\\n$ kubectl get po -o wide\\nNAME                READY  STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP          NODE\\ntest-196686-46ngl   1/1    Running   0          12s   10.47.0.1   node2.k8s\\ntest-196686-73p89   1/1    Running   0          12s   10.47.0.7   node2.k8s\\ntest-196686-77280   1/1    Running   0          12s   10.47.0.6   node2.k8s\\ntest-196686-h9m8f   1/1    Running   0          12s   10.47.0.5   node2.k8s\\ntest-196686-p85ll   1/1    Running   0          12s   10.47.0.4   node2.k8s\\nNow, no one can inadvertently deploy pods onto the production nodes. \\n16.1.3 Adding tolerations to pods\\nTo deploy production pods to the production nodes, they need to tolerate the taint\\nyou added to the nodes.

If you look at the tolerations of one of your pods, youâll see\\ntwo tolerations, which are shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl get po prod-350605-1ph5h -o yaml\\n...\\n  tolerations:\\n  - effect: NoExecute                            \\n    key: node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady       \\n    operator: Exists                             \\n    tolerationSeconds: 300                       \\n  - effect: NoExecute                              \\n    key: node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable      \\n    operator: Exists                               \\n    tolerationSeconds: 300                         \\nThese two tolerations say that this pod tolerates a node being notReady or unreach-\\nable for 300 seconds. The Kubernetes Control Plane, when it detects that a node is no\\nlonger ready or no longer reachable, will wait for 300 seconds before it deletes the\\npod and reschedules it to another node.\\n These two tolerations are automatically added to pods that donât define them. If\\nthat five-minute delay is too long for your pods, you can make the delay shorter by\\nadding those two tolerations to the podâs spec.\\nNOTE\\nThis is currently an alpha feature, so it may change in future versions\\nof Kubernetes. Taint-based evictions also arenât enabled by default. You enable\\nthem by running the Controller Manager with the --feature-gates=Taint-\\nBasedEvictions=true option.\\n16.2\\nUsing node affinity to attract pods to certain nodes\\nAs youâve learned, taints are used to keep pods away from certain nodes. Now youâll\\nlearn about a newer mechanism called node affinity, which allows you to tell Kuberne-\\ntes to schedule pods only to specific subsets of nodes.\\nCOMPARING NODE AFFINITY TO NODE SELECTORS\\nThe initial node affinity mechanism in early versions of Kubernetes was the node-\\nSelector field in the pod specification. The node had to include all the labels speci-\\nfied in that field to be eligible to become the target for the pod. \\n Node selectors get the job done and are simple, but they donât offer everything\\nthat you may need. Because of that, a more powerful mechanism was introduced.\\nListing 16.6\\nPod with default tolerations\\nThe pod tolerates the node being \\nnotReady for 300 seconds, before \\nit needs to be rescheduled.\\nThe same applies to the \\nnode being unreachable.\\n \\n',\n",

These\\nallow you to specify either hard requirements or preferences. By specifying a prefer-\\nence, you tell Kubernetes which nodes you prefer for a specific pod, and Kubernetes\\nwill try to schedule the pod to one of those nodes. If thatâs not possible, it will choose\\none of the other nodes. \\nEXAMINING THE DEFAULT NODE LABELS\\nNode affinity selects nodes based on their labels, the same way node selectors do.\\nBefore you see how to use node affinity, letâs examine the labels of one of the nodes in\\na Google Kubernetes Engine cluster (GKE) to see what the default node labels are.\\nTheyâre shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe node gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\\nName:     gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\\nRole:\\nLabels:   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=f1-micro\\n          beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\\n          cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=default-pool\\n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=europe-west1         \\n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=europe-west1-d         \\n          kubernetes.io/hostname=gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf   \\nThe node has many labels, but the last three are the most important when it comes to\\nnode affinity and pod affinity, which youâll learn about later. The meaning of those\\nthree labels is as follows:\\n\\uf0a1\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region specifies the geographical region\\nthe node is located in.\\n\\uf0a1\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone specifies the availability zone the\\nnode is in.\\n\\uf0a1\\nkubernetes.io/hostname is obviously the nodeâs hostname.\\nThese and other labels can be used in pod affinity rules. In chapter 3, you already\\nlearned how you can add a custom label to nodes and use it in a podâs node selector.\\nYou used the custom label to deploy pods only to nodes with that label by adding a node\\nselector to the pods. Now, youâll see how to do the same using node affinity rules.\\n16.2.1 Specifying hard node affinity rules\\nIn the example in chapter 3, you used the node selector to deploy a pod that requires\\na GPU only to nodes that have a GPU. The pod spec included the nodeSelector field\\nshown in the following listing.\\nListing 16.7\\nDefault labels of a node in GKE\\nThese three\\nlabels are the\\nmost important\\nones related to\\nnode affinity.\\n \\n',\n",

If those machines donât have\\nenough room for the pods or if other important reasons exist that prevent them from\\nbeing scheduled there, youâre okay with them being scheduled to the machines your\\npartners use and to the other zones. Node affinity allows you to do that.\\nLABELING NODES\\nFirst, the nodes need to be labeled appropriately. Each node needs to have a label that\\ndesignates the availability zone the node belongs to and a label marking it as either a\\ndedicated or a shared node.\\n Appendix B explains how to set up a three-node cluster (one master and two\\nworker nodes) in VMs running locally. In the following examples, Iâll use the two worker\\nnodes in that cluster, but you can also use Google Kubernetes Engine or any other\\nmulti-node cluster. \\nNOTE\\nMinikube isnât the best choice for running these examples, because it\\nruns only one node.\\nFirst, label the nodes, as shown in the next listing.\\n$ kubectl label node node1.k8s availability-zone=zone1\\nnode \"node1.k8s\" labeled\\n$ kubectl label node node1.k8s share-type=dedicated\\nnode \"node1.k8s\" labeled\\n$ kubectl label node node2.k8s availability-zone=zone2\\nnode \"node2.k8s\" labeled\\n$ kubectl label node node2.k8s share-type=shared\\nnode \"node2.k8s\" labeled\\n$ kubectl get node -L availability-zone -L share-type\\nNAME         STATUS    AGE       VERSION   AVAILABILITY-ZONE   SHARE-TYPE\\nmaster.k8s   Ready     4d        v1.6.4    <none>              <none>\\nnode1.k8s    Ready     4d        v1.6.4    zone1               dedicated\\nnode2.k8s    Ready     4d        v1.6.4    zone2               shared\\nSPECIFYING PREFERENTIAL NODE AFFINITY RULES\\nWith the node labels set up, you can now create a Deployment that prefers dedicated\\nnodes in zone1.

Why did one of them land on node2 instead of node1? The reason is\\nthat besides the node affinity prioritization function, the Scheduler also uses other pri-\\noritization functions to decide where to schedule a pod. One of those is the Selector-\\nSpreadPriority function, which makes sure pods belonging to the same ReplicaSet or\\nService are spread around different nodes so a node failure wonât bring the whole ser-\\nvice down. Thatâs most likely what caused one of the pods to be scheduled to node2.\\n You can try scaling the Deployment up to 20 or more and youâll see the majority of\\npods will be scheduled to node1. In my test, only two out of the 20 were scheduled to\\nnode2. If you hadnât defined any node affinity preferences, the pods would have been\\nspread around the two nodes evenly.\\n16.3\\nCo-locating pods with pod affinity and anti-affinity\\nYouâve seen how node affinity rules are used to influence which node a pod is scheduled\\nto. But these rules only affect the affinity between a pod and a node, whereas sometimes\\nyouâd like to have the ability to specify the affinity between pods themselves. \\n For example, imagine having a frontend and a backend pod. Having those pods\\ndeployed near to each other reduces latency and improves the performance of the\\napp. You could use node affinity rules to ensure both are deployed to the same node,\\nrack, or datacenter, but then youâd have to specify exactly which node, rack, or data-\\ncenter to schedule them to, which is not the best solution. Itâs better to let Kubernetes\\ndeploy your pods anywhere it sees fit, while keeping the frontend and backend pods\\nclose together. This can be achieved using pod affinity. Letâs learn more about it with\\nan example.\\n16.3.1 Using inter-pod affinity to deploy pods on the same node\\nYouâll deploy a backend pod and five frontend pod replicas with pod affinity config-\\nured so that theyâre all deployed on the same node as the backend pod.\\n First, deploy the backend pod:\\n$ kubectl run backend -l app=backend --image busybox -- sleep 999999\\ndeployment \"backend\" created\\nListing 16.12\\nSeeing where pods were scheduled\\n \\n',\n",

You probably donât want all your frontend pods to\\nrun on the same machine, but youâd still like to keep them close to the backend\\npodâfor example, run them in the same availability zone. \\nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME AVAILABILITY ZONE\\nThe cluster Iâm using runs in three VMs on my local machine, so all the nodes are in\\nthe same availability zone, so to speak. But if the nodes were in different zones, all Iâd\\nneed to do to run the frontend pods in the same zone as the backend pod would be to\\nchange the topologyKey property to failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone. \\nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL REGION\\nTo allow the pods to be deployed in the same region instead of the same zone (cloud\\nproviders usually have datacenters located in different geographical regions and split\\ninto multiple availability zones in each region), the topologyKey would be set to\\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region.\\nUNDERSTANDING HOW TOPOLOGYKEY WORKS\\nThe way topologyKey works is simple. The three keys weâve mentioned so far arenât\\nspecial. If you want, you can easily use your own topologyKey, such as rack, to have\\nthe pods scheduled to the same server rack. The only prerequisite is to add a rack\\nlabel to your nodes. This scenario is shown in figure 16.5.\\n For example, if you had 20 nodes, with 10 in each rack, youâd label the first ten as\\nrack=rack1 and the others as rack=rack2. Then, when defining a podâs podAffinity,\\nyouâd set the toplogyKey to rack. \\n When the Scheduler is deciding where to deploy a pod, it checks the podâs pod-\\nAffinity config, finds the pods that match the label selector, and looks up the nodes\\ntheyâre running on. Specifically, it looks up the nodesâ label whose key matches the\\ntopologyKey field specified in podAffinity. Then it selects all the nodes whose label\\n \\n',\n",

You may want to keep pods away from each other. This is called\\npod anti-affinity. Itâs specified the same way as pod affinity, except that you use the\\npodAntiAffinity property instead of podAffinity, which results in the Scheduler\\nnever choosing nodes where pods matching the podAntiAffinityâs label selector are\\nrunning, as shown in figure 16.7.\\nAn example of why youâd want to use pod anti-affinity is when two sets of pods inter-\\nfere with each otherâs performance if they run on the same node. In that case, you\\nwant to tell the Scheduler to never schedule those pods on the same node. Another\\nexample would be to force the Scheduler to spread pods of the same group across dif-\\nferent availability zones or regions, so that a failure of a whole zone (or region) never\\nbrings the service down completely. \\nListing 16.17\\nPods deployed with podAffinity preferences\\nThese pods will NOT be scheduled\\nto the same node(s) where pods\\nwith app=foo label are running.\\nSome node\\nOther nodes\\nPods\\nPod: foo\\nPod\\n(required)\\nanti-afï¬nity\\nLabel selector: app=foo\\nTopology key: hostname\\napp: foo\\nFigure 16.7\\nUsing pod anti-affinity to keep pods away from nodes that run pods \\nwith a certain label.\\n \\n',\n",

You can use it to ensure pods arenât deployed to the\\nsame rack, availability zone, region, or any custom scope you create using custom\\nnode labels.\\n16.4\\nSummary\\nIn this chapter, we looked at how to ensure pods arenât scheduled to certain nodes or\\nare only scheduled to specific nodes, either because of the nodeâs labels or because of\\nthe pods running on them.\\n You learned that\\n\\uf0a1If you add a taint to a node, pods wonât be scheduled to that node unless they\\ntolerate that taint.\\n\\uf0a1Three types of taints exist: NoSchedule completely prevents scheduling, Prefer-\\nNoSchedule isnât as strict, and NoExecute even evicts existing pods from a node.\\n\\uf0a1The NoExecute taint is also used to specify how long the Control Plane should\\nwait before rescheduling the pod when the node it runs on becomes unreach-\\nable or unready.\\n\\uf0a1Node affinity allows you to specify which nodes a pod should be scheduled to. It\\ncan be used to specify a hard requirement or to only express a node preference.\\n\\uf0a1Pod affinity is used to make the Scheduler deploy pods to the same node where\\nanother pod is running (based on the podâs labels). \\n\\uf0a1Pod affinityâs topologyKey specifies how close the pod should be deployed to\\nthe other pod (onto the same node or onto a node in the same rack, availability\\nzone, or availability region).\\n\\uf0a1Pod anti-affinity can be used to keep certain pods away from each other. \\n\\uf0a1Both pod affinity and anti-affinity, like node affinity, can either specify hard\\nrequirements or preferences.\\nIn the next chapter, youâll learn about best practices for developing apps and how to\\nmake them run smoothly in a Kubernetes environment.\\n \\n',\n",

Figure 17.1 shows the Kubernetes components used in a typical application.\\nA typical application manifest contains one or more Deployment and/or StatefulSet\\nobjects. Those include a pod template containing one or more containers, with a live-\\nness probe for each of them and a readiness probe for the service(s) the container\\nprovides (if any). Pods that provide services to others are exposed through one or\\nmore Services. When they need to be reachable from outside the cluster, the Services\\nare either configured to be LoadBalancer or NodePort-type Services, or exposed\\nthrough an Ingress resource. \\n The pod templates (and the pods created from them) usually reference two types\\nof Secretsâthose for pulling container images from private image registries and those\\nused directly by the process running inside the pods. The Secrets themselves are\\nusually not part of the application manifest, because they arenât configured by the\\napplication developers but by the operations team.

Cer-\\ntain pods use additional volumes, such as an emptyDir or a gitRepo volume, whereas\\npods requiring persistent storage use persistentVolumeClaim volumes. The Persistent-\\nVolumeClaims are also part of the application manifest, whereas StorageClasses refer-\\nenced by them are created by system administrators upfront. \\n In certain cases, an application also requires the use of Jobs or CronJobs. Daemon-\\nSets arenât normally part of application deployments, but are usually created by sysad-\\nmins to run system services on all or a subset of nodes. HorizontalPodAutoscalers\\nare either included in the manifest by the developers or added to the system later by\\nthe ops team. The cluster administrator also creates LimitRange and ResourceQuota\\nobjects to keep compute resource usage of individual pods and all the pods (as a\\nwhole) under control.\\n After the application is deployed, additional objects are created automatically by\\nthe various Kubernetes controllers. These include service Endpoints objects created\\nby the Endpoints controller, ReplicaSets created by the Deployment controller, and\\nthe actual pods created by the ReplicaSet (or Job, CronJob, StatefulSet, or DaemonSet)\\ncontrollers.\\n Resources are often labeled with one or more labels to keep them organized. This\\ndoesnât apply only to pods but to all other resources as well. In addition to labels, most\\nresources also contain annotations that describe each resource, list the contact infor-\\nmation of the person or team responsible for it, or provide additional metadata for\\nmanagement and other tools. \\n At the center of all this is the Pod, which arguably is the most important Kuberne-\\ntes resource. After all, each of your applications runs inside it. To make sure you know\\nhow to develop apps that make the most out of their environment, letâs take one last\\nclose look at podsâthis time from the applicationâs perspective. \\n17.2\\nUnderstanding the podâs lifecycle\\nWeâve said that pods can be compared to VMs dedicated to running only a single\\napplication. Although an application running inside a pod is not unlike an application\\nrunning in a VM, significant differences do exist. One example is that apps running in\\na pod can be killed any time, because Kubernetes needs to relocate the pod to\\nanother node for a reason or because of a scale-down request. Weâll explore this\\naspect next.\\n17.2.1 Applications must expect to be killed and relocated\\nOutside Kubernetes, apps running in VMs are seldom moved from one machine to\\nanother. When an operator moves the app, they can also reconfigure the app and\\nmanually check that the app is running fine in the new location. With Kubernetes,\\napps are relocated much more frequently and automaticallyâno human operator\\n \\n',\n",

This means\\napplication developers need to make sure their apps allow being moved relatively\\noften. \\nEXPECTING THE LOCAL IP AND HOSTNAME TO CHANGE\\nWhen a pod is killed and run elsewhere (technically, itâs a new pod instance replac-\\ning the old one; the pod isnât relocated), it not only has a new IP address but also a\\nnew name and hostname. Most stateless apps can usually handle this without any\\nadverse effects, but stateful apps usually canât. Weâve learned that stateful apps can\\nbe run through a StatefulSet, which ensures that when the app starts up on a new\\nnode after being rescheduled, it will still see the same host name and persistent state\\nas before. The podâs IP will change nevertheless. Apps need to be prepared for that\\nto happen. The application developer therefore should never base membership in a\\nclustered app on the memberâs IP address, and if basing it on the hostname, should\\nalways use a StatefulSet.\\nEXPECTING THE DATA WRITTEN TO DISK TO DISAPPEAR\\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that if the app writes data to disk, that data may not be\\navailable after the app is started inside a new pod, unless you mount persistent storage at\\nthe location the app is writing to. It should be clear this happens when the pod is\\nrescheduled, but files written to disk will disappear even in scenarios that donât involve\\nany rescheduling. Even during the lifetime of a single pod, the files written to disk by\\nthe app running in the pod may disappear. Let me explain this with an example.\\n Imagine an app that has a long and computationally intensive initial startup proce-\\ndure. To help the app come up faster on subsequent startups, the developers make\\nthe app cache the results of the initial startup on disk (an example of this would be\\nthe scanning of all Java classes for annotations at startup and then writing the results\\nto an index file). Because apps in Kubernetes run in containers by default, these files\\nare written to the containerâs filesystem. If the container is then restarted, theyâre all\\nlost, because the new container starts off with a completely new writable layer (see fig-\\nure 17.2).\\n Donât forget that individual containers may be restarted for several reasons, such\\nas because the process crashes, because the liveness probe returned a failure, or\\nbecause the node started running out of memory and the process was killed by the\\nOOMKiller. When this happens, the pod is still the same, but the container itself is\\ncompletely new. The Kubelet doesnât run the same container again; it always creates a\\nnew container. \\nUSING VOLUMES TO PRESERVE DATA ACROSS CONTAINER RESTARTS\\nWhen its container is restarted, the app in the example will need to perform the\\nintensive startup procedure again. This may or may not be desired. To make sure data\\nlike this isnât lost, you need to use at least a pod-scoped volume. Because volumes live\\nand die together with the pod, the new container will be able to reuse the data written\\nto the volume by the previous container (figure 17.3).\\n \\n',\n",

What if the data gets corrupted and causes the newly created process\\nto crash again? This will result in a continuous crash loop (the pod will show the\\nCrashLoopBackOff status). If you hadnât used a volume, the new container would start\\nfrom scratch and most likely not crash. Using volumes to preserve files across con-\\ntainer restarts like this is a double-edged sword. You need to think carefully about\\nwhether to use them or not.\\n17.2.2 Rescheduling of dead or partially dead pods\\nIf a podâs container keeps crashing, the Kubelet will keep restarting it indefinitely.\\nThe time between restarts will be increased exponentially until it reaches five minutes.\\nDuring those five minute intervals, the pod is essentially dead, because its containerâs\\nprocess isnât running. To be fair, if itâs a multi-container pod, certain containers may\\nbe running normally, so the pod is only partially dead. But if a pod contains only a sin-\\ngle container, the pod is effectively dead and completely useless, because no process is\\nrunning in it anymore.\\n You may find it surprising to learn that such pods arenât automatically removed\\nand rescheduled, even if theyâre part of a ReplicaSet or similar controller. If you cre-\\nate a ReplicaSet with a desired replica count of three, and then one of the containers\\nin one of those pods starts crashing, Kubernetes will not delete and replace the pod.\\nThe end result is a ReplicaSet with only two properly running replicas instead of the\\ndesired three (figure 17.4).\\nYouâd probably expect the pod to be deleted and replaced with another pod instance\\nthat might run successfully on another node. After all, the container may be crashing\\nbecause of a node-related problem that doesnât manifest itself on other nodes. Sadly,\\nthat isnât the case.

You have\\nno guarantee that pods will also be started in that order. \\n But you can prevent a podâs main container from starting until a precondition is\\nmet. This is done by including an init containers in the pod. \\nINTRODUCING INIT CONTAINERS\\nIn addition to regular containers, pods can also include init containers. As the name\\nsuggests, they can be used to initialize the podâthis often means writing data to the\\npodâs volumes, which are then mounted into the podâs main container(s).\\n A pod may have any number of init containers. Theyâre executed sequentially and\\nonly after the last one completes are the podâs main containers started. This means\\ninit containers can also be used to delay the start of the podâs main container(s)âfor\\nexample, until a certain precondition is met. An init container could wait for a service\\nrequired by the podâs main container to be up and ready. When it is, the init container\\nterminates and allows the main container(s) to be started. This way, the main con-\\ntainer wouldnât use the service before itâs ready.\\n Letâs look at an example of a pod using an init container to delay the start of the\\nmain container. Remember the fortune pod you created in chapter 7? Itâs a web\\nserver that returns a fortune quote as a response to client requests. Now, letâs imagine\\nyou have a fortune-client pod that requires the fortune Service to be up and run-\\nning before its main container starts. You can add an init container, which checks\\nwhether the Service is responding to requests. Until thatâs the case, the init container\\nkeeps retrying. Once it gets a response, the init container terminates and lets the main\\ncontainer start.\\nADDING AN INIT CONTAINER TO A POD\\nInit containers can be defined in the pod spec like main containers but through the\\nspec.initContainers field. Youâll find the complete YAML for the fortune-client pod\\nin the bookâs code archive.

If an app canât do its job because one\\nof its dependencies is missing, it should signal that through its readiness probe, so\\nKubernetes knows it, too, isnât ready. Youâll want to do this not only because it pre-\\nvents the app from being added as a service endpoint, but also because the appâs read-\\niness is also used by the Deployment controller when performing a rolling update,\\nthereby preventing a rollout of a bad version. \\n17.2.4 Adding lifecycle hooks\\nWeâve talked about how init containers can be used to hook into the startup of the\\npod, but pods also allow you to define two lifecycle hooks:\\n\\uf0a1Post-start hooks\\n\\uf0a1Pre-stop hooks\\nThese lifecycle hooks are specified per container, unlike init containers, which apply\\nto the whole pod.

Sure, if youâre\\nthe author of the application running in the container, you can always perform those\\noperations inside the application code itself. But when youâre running an application\\ndeveloped by someone else, you mostly donât want to (or canât) modify its source\\ncode. Post-start hooks allow you to run additional commands without having to touch\\nthe app. These may signal to an external listener that the app is starting, or they may\\ninitialize the application so it can start doing its job.\\n The hook is run in parallel with the main process. The name might be somewhat\\nmisleading, because it doesnât wait for the main process to start up fully (if the process\\nhas an initialization procedure, the Kubelet obviously canât wait for the procedure to\\ncomplete, because it has no way of knowing when that is). \\n But even though the hook runs asynchronously, it does affect the container in two\\nways. Until the hook completes, the container will stay in the Waiting state with the\\nreason ContainerCreating. Because of this, the podâs status will be Pending instead of\\nRunning. If the hook fails to run or returns a non-zero exit code, the main container\\nwill be killed. \\n A pod manifest containing a post-start hook looks like the following listing.\\napiVersion: v1\\nkind: Pod\\nmetadata:\\n  name: pod-with-poststart-hook\\nspec:\\n  containers:\\n  - image: luksa/kubia\\n    name: kubia\\n    lifecycle:          \\n      postStart:        \\n        exec:                                                               \\n          command:                                                          \\n          - sh                                                              \\n          - -c                                                              \\n          - \"echo \\'hook will fail with exit code 15\\'; sleep 5; exit 15\"     \\nIn the example, the echo, sleep, and exit commands are executed along with the\\ncontainerâs main process as soon as the container is created. Rather than run a com-\\nmand like this, youâd typically run a shell script or a binary executable file stored in\\nthe container image. \\n Sadly, if the process started by the hook logs to the standard output, you canât see\\nthe output anywhere. This makes debugging lifecycle hooks painful. If the hook fails,\\nListing 17.3\\nA pod with a post-start lifecycle hook: post-start-hook.yaml\\nThe hook is executed as \\nthe container starts.\\nIt executes the\\npostStart.sh\\nscript in the /bin\\ndirectory inside\\nthe container.\\n \\n',\n",

The\\nfollowing listing shows how to define a pre-stop HTTP GET hook in a pod.\\n    lifecycle:\\n      preStop:            \\n        httpGet:          \\n          port: 8080          \\n          path: shutdown      \\nThe pre-stop hook defined in this listing performs an HTTP GET request to http:/\\n/\\nPOD_IP:8080/shutdown as soon as the Kubelet starts terminating the container.\\nApart from the port and path shown in the listing, you can also set the fields scheme\\n(HTTP or HTTPS) and host, as well as httpHeaders that should be sent in the\\nrequest. The host field defaults to the pod IP. Be sure not to set it to localhost,\\nbecause localhost would refer to the node, not the pod.\\n In contrast to the post-start hook, the container will be terminated regardless of\\nthe result of the hookâan error HTTP response code or a non-zero exit code when\\nusing a command-based hook will not prevent the container from being terminated.\\nIf the pre-stop hook fails, youâll see a FailedPreStopHook warning event among the\\npodâs events, but because the pod is deleted soon afterward (after all, the podâs dele-\\ntion is what triggered the pre-stop hook in the first place), you may not even notice\\nthat the pre-stop hook failed to run properly. \\nTIP\\nIf the successful completion of the pre-stop hook is critical to the proper\\noperation of your system, verify whether itâs being executed at all. Iâve wit-\\nnessed situations where the pre-stop hook didnât run and the developer\\nwasnât even aware of that.\\nUSING A PRE-STOP HOOK BECAUSE YOUR APP DOESNâT RECEIVE THE SIGTERM SIGNAL\\nMany developers make the mistake of defining a pre-stop hook solely to send a SIGTERM\\nsignal to their apps in the pre-stop hook. They do this because they donât see their appli-\\ncation receive the SIGTERM signal sent by the Kubelet. The reason why the signal isnât\\nreceived by the application isnât because Kubernetes isnât sending it, but because the sig-\\nnal isnât being passed to the app process inside the container itself. If your container\\nimage is configured to run a shell, which in turn runs the app process, the signal may be\\neaten up by the shell itself, instead of being passed down to the child process.\\n In such cases, instead of adding a pre-stop hook to send the signal directly to your\\napp, the proper fix is to make sure the shell passes the signal to the app. This can be\\nachieved by handling the signal in the shell script running as the main container pro-\\ncess and then passing it on to the app. Or you could not configure the container image\\nto run a shell at all and instead run the application binary directly. You do this by using\\nthe exec form of ENTRYPOINT or CMD in the Dockerfile: ENTRYPOINT [\"/mybinary\"]\\ninstead of ENTRYPOINT /mybinary.\\nListing 17.6\\nA pre-stop hook YAML snippet: pre-stop-hook-httpget.yaml\\nThis is a pre-stop hook that \\nperforms an HTTP GET request.\\nThe request is sent to \\nhttp://POD_IP:8080/shutdown.\\n \\n',\n",

This may happen multiple times in the podâs life-\\ntime, not only when the pod is in the process of being shut down. \\n17.2.5 Understanding pod shutdown\\nWeâve touched on the subject of pod termination, so letâs explore this subject in more\\ndetail and go over exactly what happens during pod shutdown. This is important for\\nunderstanding how to cleanly shut down an application running in a pod.\\n Letâs start at the beginning. A podâs shut-down is triggered by the deletion of the\\nPod object through the API server. Upon receiving an HTTP DELETE request, the\\nAPI server doesnât delete the object yet, but only sets a deletionTimestamp field in it.\\nPods that have the deletionTimestamp field set are terminating. \\n Once the Kubelet notices the pod needs to be terminated, it starts terminating\\neach of the podâs containers. It gives each container time to shut down gracefully, but\\nthe time is limited. That time is called the termination grace period and is configu-\\nrable per pod. The timer starts as soon as the termination process starts. Then the fol-\\nlowing sequence of events is performed:\\n1\\nRun the pre-stop hook, if one is configured, and wait for it to finish.\\n2\\nSend the SIGTERM signal to the main process of the container.\\n3\\nWait until the container shuts down cleanly or until the termination grace\\nperiod runs out.\\n4\\nForcibly kill the process with SIGKILL, if it hasnât terminated gracefully yet.\\nThe sequence of events is illustrated in figure 17.5.\\nPre-stop hook process\\nTermination grace period\\nMain container process\\nContainer shutdown\\ninitiated\\nContainer killed\\nif still running\\nTime\\nSIGTERM\\nSIGKILL\\nFigure 17.5\\nThe container termination sequence\\n \\n',\n",

This is not recommended for at least the following two reasons:\\n\\uf0a1A container terminating doesnât necessarily mean the whole pod is being\\nterminated.\\n\\uf0a1You have no guarantee the shut-down procedure will finish before the process\\nis killed.\\nThis second scenario doesnât happen only when the grace period runs out before the\\napplication has finished shutting down gracefully, but also when the node running\\nthe pod fails in the middle of the container shut-down sequence. Even if the node\\nthen starts up again, the Kubelet will not restart the shut-down procedure (it wonât\\neven start up the container again). There are absolutely no guarantees that the pod\\nwill be allowed to complete its whole shut-down procedure.\\nREPLACING CRITICAL SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURES WITH DEDICATED SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURE PODS\\nHow do you ensure that a critical shut-down procedure that absolutely must run to\\ncompletion does run to completion (for example, to ensure that a podâs data is\\nmigrated to other pods)?\\n One solution is for the app (upon receipt of a termination signal) to create a new\\nJob resource that would run a new pod, whose sole job is to migrate the deleted podâs\\ndata to the remaining pods. But if youâve been paying attention, youâll know that you\\nhave no guarantee the app will indeed manage to create the Job object every single\\ntime. What if the node fails exactly when the app tries to do that? \\n The proper way to handle this problem is by having a dedicated, constantly run-\\nning pod that keeps checking for the existence of orphaned data. When this pod finds\\nthe orphaned data, it can migrate it to the remaining pods. Rather than a constantly\\nrunning pod, you can also use a CronJob resource and run the pod periodically. \\n You may think StatefulSets could help here, but they donât. As youâll remember,\\nscaling down a StatefulSet leaves PersistentVolumeClaims orphaned, leaving the data\\nstored on the PersistentVolume stranded. Yes, upon a subsequent scale-up, the Persistent-\\nVolume will be reattached to the new pod instance, but what if that scale-up never\\nhappens (or happens after a long time)? For this reason, you may want to run a\\ndata-migrating pod also when using StatefulSets (this scenario is shown in figure 17.6).\\nTo prevent the migration from occurring during an application upgrade, the data-\\nmigrating pod could be configured to wait a while to give the stateful pod time to\\ncome up again before performing the migration.\\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Now, weâll look at\\nthe podâs lifecycle from the perspective of the podâs clients (clients consuming the ser-\\nvice the pod is providing). This is important to understand if you donât want clients to\\nrun into problems when you scale pods up or down.\\n It goes without saying that you want all client requests to be handled properly. You\\nobviously donât want to see broken connections when pods are starting up or shutting\\ndown. By itself, Kubernetes doesnât prevent this from happening. Your app needs to\\nfollow a few rules to prevent broken connections. First, letâs focus on making sure all\\nconnections are handled properly when the pod starts up.\\n17.3.1 Preventing broken client connections when a pod is starting up\\nEnsuring each connection is handled properly at pod startup is simple if you under-\\nstand how Services and service Endpoints work. When a pod is started, itâs added as an\\nendpoint to all the Services, whose label selector matches the podâs labels. As you may\\nremember from chapter 5, the pod also needs to signal to Kubernetes that itâs ready.\\nUntil it is, it wonât become a service endpoint and therefore wonât receive any requests\\nfrom clients. \\n If you donât specify a readiness probe in your pod spec, the pod is always considered\\nready. It will start receiving requests almost immediatelyâas soon as the first kube-proxy\\nupdates the iptables rules on its node and the first client pod tries to connect to the\\nservice. If your app isnât ready to accept connections by then, clients will see âconnec-\\ntion refusedâ types of errors.\\n All you need to do is make sure that your readiness probe returns success only\\nwhen your app is ready to properly handle incoming requests. A good first step is to\\nadd an HTTP GET readiness probe and point it to the base URL of your app. In many\\nPod\\nA-0\\nPod\\nA-1\\nStatefulSet A\\nReplicas: 2\\nScale\\ndown\\nPVC\\nA-0\\nPV\\nPVC\\nA-1\\nPV\\nPod\\nA-0\\nStatefulSet A\\nReplicas: 1\\nTransfers data to\\nremaining pod(s)\\nConnects to\\norphaned PVC\\nData-migrating\\nPod\\nJob\\nPVC\\nA-0\\nPV\\nPVC\\nA-1\\nPV\\nFigure 17.6\\nUsing a dedicated pod to migrate data \\n \\n',\n",

Weâve already talked about how the podâs containers\\nshould start shutting down cleanly as soon they receive the SIGTERM signal (or when its\\npre-stop hook is executed). But does that ensure all client requests are handled properly? \\n How should the app behave when it receives a termination signal? Should it con-\\ntinue to accept requests? What about requests that have already been received but\\nhavenât completed yet? What about persistent HTTP connections, which may be in\\nbetween requests, but are open (when no active request exists on the connection)?\\nBefore we can answer those questions, we need to take a detailed look at the chain of\\nevents that unfolds across the cluster when a Pod is deleted. \\nUNDERSTANDING THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OCCURRING AT POD DELETION\\nIn chapter 11 we took an in-depth look at what components make up a Kubernetes clus-\\nter. You need to always keep in mind that those components run as separate processes on\\nmultiple machines. They arenât all part of a single big monolithic process. It takes time\\nfor all the components to be on the same page regarding the state of the cluster. Letâs\\nexplore this fact by looking at what happens across the cluster when a Pod is deleted.\\n When a request for a pod deletion is received by the API server, it first modifies the\\nstate in etcd and then notifies its watchers of the deletion. Among those watchers are\\nthe Kubelet and the Endpoints controller. The two sequences of events, which happen\\nin parallel (marked with either A or B), are shown in figure 17.7.\\nA2.

If the app\\nresponds to the SIGTERM by immediately ceasing to receive client requests, any client\\ntrying to connect to it will receive a Connection Refused error. The time it takes for\\nthis to happen from the time the pod is deleted is relatively short because of the direct\\npath from the API server to the Kubelet.\\n Now, letâs look at what happens in the other sequence of eventsâthe one leading\\nup to the pod being removed from the iptables rules (sequence B in the figure).\\nWhen the Endpoints controller (which runs in the Controller Manager in the Kuber-\\nnetes Control Plane) receives the notification of the Pod being deleted, it removes\\nthe pod as an endpoint in all services that the pod is a part of. It does this by modify-\\ning the Endpoints API object by sending a REST request to the API server. The API\\nserver then notifies all clients watching the Endpoints object. Among those watchers\\nare all the kube-proxies running on the worker nodes. Each of these proxies then\\nupdates the iptables rules on its node, which is what prevents new connections\\nfrom being forwarded to the terminating pod. An important detail here is that\\nremoving the iptables rules has no effect on existing connectionsâclients who are\\nalready connected to the pod will still send additional requests to the pod through\\nthose existing connections.\\n Both of these sequences of events happen in parallel. Most likely, the time it takes\\nto shut down the appâs process in the pod is slightly shorter than the time required for\\nthe iptables rules to be updated. The chain of events that leads to iptables rules\\nbeing updated is considerably longer (see figure 17.8), because the event must first\\nreach the Endpoints controller, which then sends a new request to the API server, and\\nA2.

       "  'text': '495\\nEnsuring all client requests are handled properly\\nthen the API server must notify the kube-proxy before the proxy finally modifies the\\niptables rules. A high probability exists that the SIGTERM signal will be sent well\\nbefore the iptables rules are updated on all nodes.\\n The end result is that the pod may still receive client requests after it was sent the\\ntermination signal. If the app closes the server socket and stops accepting connections\\nimmediately, this will cause clients to receive âConnection Refusedâ types of errors\\n(similar to what happens at pod startup if your app isnât capable of accepting connec-\\ntions immediately and you donât define a readiness probe for it). \\nSOLVING THE PROBLEM\\nGoogling solutions to this problem makes it seem as though adding a readiness probe\\nto your pod will solve the problem. Supposedly, all you need to do is make the readi-\\nness probe start failing as soon as the pod receives the SIGTERM. This is supposed to\\ncause the pod to be removed as the endpoint of the service. But the removal would\\nhappen only after the readiness probe fails for a few consecutive times (this is configu-\\nrable in the readiness probe spec). And, obviously, the removal then still needs to\\nreach the kube-proxy before the pod is removed from iptables rules. \\n In reality, the readiness probe has absolutely no bearing on the whole process at\\nall. The Endpoints controller removes the pod from the service Endpoints as soon as\\nit receives notice of the pod being deleted (when the deletionTimestamp field in the\\npodâs spec is no longer null). From that point on, the result of the readiness probe\\nis irrelevant.\\n Whatâs the proper solution to the problem? How can you make sure all requests\\nare handled fully?\\n Itâs clear the pod needs to keep accepting connections even after it receives the ter-\\nmination signal up until all the kube-proxies have finished updating the iptables\\nrules. Well, itâs not only the kube-proxies. There may also be Ingress controllers or\\nload balancers forwarding connections to the pod directly, without going through the\\nService (iptables). This also includes clients using client-side load-balancing. To\\nensure none of the clients experience broken connections, youâd have to wait until all\\nof them somehow notify you theyâll no longer forward connections to the pod. \\n Thatâs impossible, because all those components are distributed across many dif-\\nferent computers. Even if you knew the location of every one of them and could wait\\nuntil all of them say itâs okay to shut down the pod, what do you do if one of them\\ndoesnât respond? How long do you wait for the response? Remember, during that\\ntime, youâre holding up the shut-down process. \\n The only reasonable thing you can do is wait for a long-enough time to ensure all\\nthe proxies have done their job. But how long is long enough? A few seconds should\\nbe enough in most situations, but thereâs no guarantee it will suffice every time. When\\nthe API server or the Endpoints controller is overloaded, it may take longer for the\\nnotification to reach the kube-proxy. Itâs important to understand that you canât solve\\nthe problem perfectly, but even adding a 5- or 10-second delay should improve the\\nuser experience considerably. You can use a longer delay, but donât go overboard,\\n \\n',\n",

If your app already\\nensures all in-flight requests are processed completely, this pre-stop delay may be all\\nyou need.\\n17.4\\nMaking your apps easy to run and manage in Kubernetes\\nI hope you now have a better sense of how to make your apps handle clients nicely.\\nNow weâll look at other aspects of how an app should be built to make it easier to man-\\nage in Kubernetes.\\n17.4.1 Making manageable container images\\nWhen you package your app into an image, you can choose to include the appâs\\nbinary executable and any additional libraries it needs, or you can package up a whole\\nOS filesystem along with the app. Way too many people do this, even though itâs usu-\\nally unnecessary.\\n Do you need every single file from an OS distribution in your image? Probably not.\\nMost of the files will never be used and will make your image larger than it needs to\\nbe. Sure, the layering of images makes sure each individual layer is downloaded only\\nonce, but even having to wait longer than necessary the first time a pod is scheduled\\nto a node is undesirable.\\n Deploying new pods and scaling them should be fast. This demands having small\\nimages without unnecessary cruft. If youâre building apps using the Go language, your\\nimages donât need to include anything else apart from the appâs single binary execut-\\nable file. This makes Go-based container images extremely small and perfect for\\nKubernetes.\\nTIP\\nUse the FROM scratch directive in the Dockerfile for these images.\\nBut in practice, youâll soon see these minimal images are extremely difficult to debug.\\nThe first time you need to run a tool such as ping, dig, curl, or something similar\\ninside the container, youâll realize how important it is for container images to also\\ninclude at least a limited set of these tools. I canât tell you what to include and what\\nnot to include in your images, because it depends on how you do things, so youâll\\nneed to find the sweet spot yourself.\\n17.4.2 Properly tagging your images and using imagePullPolicy wisely\\nYouâll also soon learn that referring to the latest image tag in your pod manifests will\\ncause problems, because you canât tell which version of the image each individual pod\\nreplica is running. Even if initially all your pod replicas run the same image version, if\\nyou push a new version of the image under the latest tag, and then pods are resched-\\nuled (or you scale up your Deployment), the new pods will run the new version,\\nwhereas the old ones will still be running the old one. Also, using the latest tag\\nmakes it impossible to roll back to a previous version (unless you push the old version\\nof the image again).\\n \\n',\n",

Keep in mind that if you use mutable tags\\n(you push changes to the same tag), youâll need to set the imagePullPolicy field in\\nthe pod spec to Always. But if you use that in production pods, be aware of the big\\ncaveat associated with it. If the image pull policy is set to Always, the container run-\\ntime will contact the image registry every time a new pod is deployed. This slows\\ndown pod startup a bit, because the node needs to check if the image has been mod-\\nified. Worse yet, this policy prevents the pod from starting up when the registry can-\\nnot be contacted.\\n17.4.3 Using multi-dimensional instead of single-dimensional labels\\nDonât forget to label all your resources, not only Pods. Make sure you add multiple\\nlabels to each resource, so they can be selected across each individual dimension. You\\n(or the ops team) will be grateful you did it when the number of resources increases.\\n Labels may include things like\\n\\uf0a1The name of the application (or perhaps microservice) the resource belongs to\\n\\uf0a1Application tier (front-end, back-end, and so on)\\n\\uf0a1Environment (development, QA, staging, production, and so on)\\n\\uf0a1Version\\n\\uf0a1Type of release (stable, canary, green or blue for green/blue deployments, and\\nso on)\\n\\uf0a1Tenant (if youâre running separate pods for each tenant instead of using name-\\nspaces)\\n\\uf0a1Shard for sharded systems\\nThis will allow you to manage resources in groups instead of individually and make it\\neasy to see where each resource belongs.\\n17.4.4 Describing each resource through annotations\\nTo add additional information to your resources use annotations. At the least,\\nresources should contain an annotation describing the resource and an annotation\\nwith contact information of the person responsible for it. \\n In a microservices architecture, pods could contain an annotation that lists the\\nnames of the other services the pod is using. This makes it possible to show dependen-\\ncies between pods. Other annotations could include build and version information\\nand metadata used by tooling or graphical user interfaces (icon names, and so on).\\n Both labels and annotations make managing running applications much easier, but\\nnothing is worse than when an application starts crashing and you donât know why.\\n17.4.5 Providing information on why the process terminated\\nNothing is more frustrating than having to figure out why a container terminated\\n(or is even terminating continuously), especially if it happens at the worst possible\\n \\n',\n",

This makes it easy to view logs with the kubectl\\nlogs command. \\nTIP\\nIf a container crashes and is replaced with a new one, youâll see the new\\ncontainerâs log. To see the previous containerâs logs, use the --previous\\noption with kubectl logs.\\nIf the application logs to a file instead of the standard output, you can display the log\\nfile using an alternative approach: \\n$ kubectl exec <pod> cat <logfile>\\nThis executes the cat command inside the container and streams the logs back to\\nkubectl, which prints them out in your terminal. \\nCOPYING LOG AND OTHER FILES TO AND FROM A CONTAINER\\nYou can also copy the log file to your local machine using the kubectl cp command,\\nwhich we havenât looked at yet. It allows you to copy files from and into a container. For\\nexample, if a pod called foo-pod and its single container contains a file at /var/log/\\nfoo.log, you can transfer it to your local machine with the following command:\\n$ kubectl cp foo-pod:/var/log/foo.log foo.log\\nTo copy a file from your local machine into the pod, specify the podâs name in the sec-\\nond argument:\\n$ kubectl cp localfile foo-pod:/etc/remotefile\\n \\n',\n",

This\\nallows you to examine historical logs and analyze trends. Without such a system, a\\npodâs logs are only available while the pod exists. As soon as itâs deleted, its logs are\\ndeleted also. \\n Kubernetes by itself doesnât provide any kind of centralized logging. The compo-\\nnents necessary for providing a centralized storage and analysis of all the container\\nlogs must be provided by additional components, which usually run as regular pods in\\nthe cluster. \\n Deploying centralized logging solutions is easy. All you need to do is deploy a few\\nYAML/JSON manifests and youâre good to go. On Google Kubernetes Engine, itâs\\neven easier. Check the Enable Stackdriver Logging checkbox when setting up the clus-\\nter. Setting up centralized logging on an on-premises Kubernetes cluster is beyond the\\nscope of this book, but Iâll give you a quick overview of how itâs usually done.\\n You may have already heard of the ELK stack composed of ElasticSearch, Logstash,\\nand Kibana. A slightly modified variation is the EFK stack, where Logstash is replaced\\nwith FluentD. \\n When using the EFK stack for centralized logging, each Kubernetes cluster node\\nruns a FluentD agent (usually as a pod deployed through a DaemonSet), which is\\nresponsible for gathering the logs from the containers, tagging them with pod-specific\\ninformation, and delivering them to ElasticSearch, which stores them persistently.\\nElasticSearch is also deployed as a pod somewhere in the cluster. The logs can then be\\nviewed and analyzed in a web browser through Kibana, which is a web tool for visualiz-\\ning ElasticSearch data. It also usually runs as a pod and is exposed through a Service.\\nThe three components of the EFK stack are shown in the following figure.\\nNOTE\\nIn the next chapter, youâll learn about Helm charts.

Thereâs one problem with that. Log statements spanning multiple lines,\\nsuch as exception stack traces in Java, appear as separate entries in the centralized\\nlogging system. \\n To solve this problem, you can have the apps output JSON instead of plain text.\\nThis way, a multiline log statement can be stored and shown in Kibana as a single\\nentry. But that makes viewing logs with kubectl logs much less human-friendly. \\n The solution may be to keep outputting human-readable logs to standard output,\\nwhile writing JSON logs to a file and having them processed by FluentD. This requires\\nconfiguring the node-level FluentD agent appropriately or adding a logging sidecar\\ncontainer to every pod. \\n17.5\\nBest practices for development and testing\\nWeâve talked about what to be mindful of when developing apps, but we havenât\\ntalked about the development and testing workflows that will help you streamline\\nthose processes. I donât want to go into too much detail here, because everyone needs\\nto find what works best for them, but here are a few starting points.\\n17.5.1 Running apps outside of Kubernetes during development\\nWhen youâre developing an app that will run in a production Kubernetes cluster, does\\nthat mean you also need to run it in Kubernetes during development? Not really. Hav-\\ning to build the app after each minor change, then build the container image, push it\\nto a registry, and then re-deploy the pods would make development slow and painful.\\nLuckily, you donât need to go through all that trouble.\\n You can always develop and run apps on your local machine, the way youâre used\\nto. After all, an app running in Kubernetes is a regular (although isolated) process\\nrunning on one of the cluster nodes. If the app depends on certain features the\\nKubernetes environment provides, you can easily replicate that environment on your\\ndevelopment machine.\\n Iâm not even talking about running the app in a container. Most of the time, you\\ndonât need thatâyou can usually run the app directly from your IDE. \\nCONNECTING TO BACKEND SERVICES\\nIn production, if the app connects to a backend Service and uses the BACKEND_SERVICE\\n_HOST and BACKEND_SERVICE_PORT environment variables to find the Serviceâs coordi-\\nnates, you can obviously set those environment variables on your local machine manu-\\nally and point them to the backend Service, regardless of if itâs running outside or\\ninside a Kubernetes cluster. If itâs running inside Kubernetes, you can always (at least\\ntemporarily) make the Service accessible externally by changing it to a NodePort or a\\nLoadBalancer-type Service. \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '503\\nBest practices for development and testing\\nCONNECTING TO THE API SERVER\\nSimilarly, if your app requires access to the Kubernetes API server when running\\ninside a Kubernetes cluster, it can easily talk to the API server from outside the cluster\\nduring development. If it uses the ServiceAccountâs token to authenticate itself, you\\ncan always copy the ServiceAccountâs Secretâs files to your local machine with kubectl\\ncp. The API server doesnât care if the client accessing it is inside or outside the cluster. \\n If the app uses an ambassador container like the one described in chapter 8, you\\ndonât even need those Secret files. Run kubectl proxy on your local machine, run\\nyour app locally, and it should be ready to talk to your local kubectl proxy (as long as\\nit and the ambassador container bind the proxy to the same port).\\n In this case, youâll need to make sure the user account your local kubectl is using\\nhas the same privileges as the ServiceAccount the app will run under.\\nRUNNING INSIDE A CONTAINER EVEN DURING DEVELOPMENT\\nWhen during development you absolutely have to run the app in a container for what-\\never reason, there is a way of avoiding having to build the container image every time.\\nInstead of baking the binaries into the image, you can always mount your local filesys-\\ntem into the container through Docker volumes, for example. This way, after you\\nbuild a new version of the appâs binaries, all you need to do is restart the container (or\\nnot even that, if hot-redeploy is supported). No need to rebuild the image.\\n17.5.2 Using Minikube in development\\nAs you can see, nothing forces you to run your app inside Kubernetes during develop-\\nment. But you may do that anyway to see how the app behaves in a true Kubernetes\\nenvironment.\\n You may have used Minikube to run examples in this book. Although a Minikube\\ncluster runs only a single worker node, itâs nevertheless a valuable method of trying\\nout your app in Kubernetes (and, of course, developing all the resource manifests that\\nmake up your complete application). Minikube doesnât offer everything that a proper\\nmulti-node Kubernetes cluster usually provides, but in most cases, that doesnât matter.\\nMOUNTING LOCAL FILES INTO THE MINIKUBE VM AND THEN INTO YOUR CONTAINERS\\nWhen youâre developing with Minikube and youâd like to try out every change to your\\napp in your Kubernetes cluster, you can mount your local filesystem into the Minikube\\nVM using the minikube mount command and then mount it into your containers\\nthrough a hostPath volume. Youâll find additional instructions on how to do that\\nin the Minikube documentation at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/minikube/tree/\\nmaster/docs.\\nUSING THE DOCKER DAEMON INSIDE THE MINIKUBE VM TO BUILD YOUR IMAGES\\nIf youâre developing your app with Minikube and planning to build the container\\nimage after every change, you can use the Docker daemon inside the Minikube VM to\\ndo the building, instead of having to build the image through your local Docker dae-\\nmon, push it to a registry, and then have it pulled by the daemon in the VM.

Luckily, this is much easier than it sounds. All you need to do is\\nrun the following command on your local machine:\\n$ eval $(minikube docker-env)\\nThis will set all the required environment variables for you. You then build your\\nimages the same way as if the Docker daemon was running on your local machine.\\nAfter you build the image, you donât need to push it anywhere, because itâs already\\nstored locally on the Minikube VM, which means new pods can use the image immedi-\\nately. If your pods are already running, you either need to delete them or kill their\\ncontainers so theyâre restarted.\\nBUILDING IMAGES LOCALLY AND COPYING THEM OVER TO THE MINIKUBE VM DIRECTLY\\nIf you canât use the daemon inside the VM to build the images, you still have a way to\\navoid having to push the image to a registry and have the Kubelet running in the\\nMinikube VM pull it. If you build the image on your local machine, you can copy it\\nover to the Minikube VM with the following command:\\n$ docker save <image> | (eval $(minikube docker-env) && docker load)\\nAs before, the image is immediately ready to be used in a pod. But make sure the\\nimagePullPolicy in your pod spec isnât set to Always, because that would cause the\\nimage to be pulled from the external registry again and youâd lose the changes youâve\\ncopied over.\\nCOMBINING MINIKUBE WITH A PROPER KUBERNETES CLUSTER\\nYou have virtually no limit when developing apps with Minikube. You can even com-\\nbine a Minikube cluster with a proper Kubernetes cluster. I sometimes run my devel-\\nopment workloads in my local Minikube cluster and have them talk to my other\\nworkloads that are deployed in a remote multi-node Kubernetes cluster thousands of\\nmiles away. \\n Once Iâm finished with development, I can move my local workloads to the remote\\ncluster with no modifications and with absolutely no problems thanks to how Kuber-\\nnetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure from the app.\\n17.5.3 Versioning and auto-deploying resource manifests\\nBecause Kubernetes uses a declarative model, you never have to figure out the current\\nstate of your deployed resources and issue imperative commands to bring that state to\\nwhat you desire. All you need to do is tell Kubernetes your desired state and it will take\\nall the necessary actions to reconcile the cluster state with the desired state.\\n You can store your collection of resource manifests in a Version Control System,\\nenabling you to perform code reviews, keep an audit trail, and roll back changes\\nwhenever necessary. After each commit, you can run the kubectl apply command to\\nhave your changes reflected in your deployed resources. \\n \\n',\n",

Luckily, the people at\\nBox (which coincidently was used to host this bookâs manuscript and other materials)\\ndeveloped and released a tool called kube-applier, which does exactly what I described.\\nYouâll find the toolâs source code at https:/\\n/github.com/box/kube-applier.\\n You can use multiple branches to deploy the manifests to a development, QA, stag-\\ning, and production cluster (or in different namespaces in the same cluster).\\n17.5.4 Introducing Ksonnet as an alternative to writing YAML/JSON \\nmanifests\\nWeâve seen a number of YAML manifests throughout the book. I donât see writing\\nYAML as too big of a problem, especially once you learn how to use kubectl explain\\nto see the available options, but some people do. \\n Just as I was finalizing the manuscript for this book, a new tool called Ksonnet was\\nannounced. Itâs a library built on top of Jsonnet, which is a data templating language\\nfor building JSON data structures. Instead of writing the complete JSON by hand, it\\nlets you define parameterized JSON fragments, give them a name, and then build a\\nfull JSON manifest by referencing those fragments by name, instead of repeating the\\nsame JSON code in multiple locationsâmuch like you use functions or methods in a\\nprogramming language. \\n Ksonnet defines the fragments youâd find in Kubernetes resource manifests, allow-\\ning you to quickly build a complete Kubernetes resource JSON manifest with much\\nless code. The following listing shows an example.\\nlocal k = import \"../ksonnet-lib/ksonnet.beta.1/k.libsonnet\";\\nlocal container = k.core.v1.container;\\nlocal deployment = k.apps.v1beta1.deployment;\\nlocal kubiaContainer =                              \\n  container.default(\"kubia\", \"luksa/kubia:v1\") +    \\n  container.helpers.namedPort(\"http\", 8080);        \\ndeployment.default(\"kubia\", kubiaContainer) +    \\ndeployment.mixin.spec.replicas(3)                \\nThe kubia.ksonnet file shown in the listing is converted to a full JSON Deployment\\nmanifest when you run the following command:\\n$ jsonnet kubia.ksonnet\\nListing 17.10\\nThe kubia Deployment written with Ksonnet: kubia.ksonnet\\nThis defines a container called kubia, \\nwhich uses the luksa/kubia:v1 image \\nand includes a port called http.\\nThis will be expanded into a full \\nDeployment resource.

       "  'text': '509\\nDefining custom API objects\\n As the Kubernetes ecosystem evolves, youâll see more and more high-level objects,\\nwhich will be much more specialized than the resources Kubernetes supports today.\\nInstead of dealing with Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and the like, youâll create\\nand manage objects that represent whole applications or software services. A custom\\ncontroller will observe those high-level objects and create low-level objects based on\\nthem. For example, to run a messaging broker inside a Kubernetes cluster, all youâll\\nneed to do is create an instance of a Queue resource and all the necessary Secrets,\\nDeployments, and Services will be created by a custom Queue controller. Kubernetes\\nalready provides ways of adding custom resources like this. \\n18.1.1 Introducing CustomResourceDefinitions\\nTo define a new resource type, all you need to do is post a CustomResourceDefinition\\nobject (CRD) to the Kubernetes API server. The CustomResourceDefinition object is\\nthe description of the custom resource type. Once the CRD is posted, users can then\\ncreate instances of the custom resource by posting JSON or YAML manifests to the\\nAPI server, the same as with any other Kubernetes resource.\\nNOTE\\nPrior to Kubernetes 1.7, custom resources were defined through Third-\\nPartyResource objects, which were similar to CustomResourceDefinitions, but\\nwere removed in version 1.8.\\nCreating a CRD so that users can create objects of the new type isnât a useful feature if\\nthose objects donât make something tangible happen in the cluster. Each CRD will\\nusually also have an associated controller (an active component doing something\\nbased on the custom objects), the same way that all the core Kubernetes resources\\nhave an associated controller, as was explained in chapter 11. For this reason, to prop-\\nerly show what CustomResourceDefinitions allow you to do other than adding\\ninstances of a custom object, a controller must be deployed as well. Youâll do that in\\nthe next example.\\nINTRODUCING THE EXAMPLE CUSTOMRESOURCEDEFINITION\\nLetâs imagine you want to allow users of your Kubernetes cluster to run static websites\\nas easily as possible, without having to deal with Pods, Services, and other Kubernetes\\nresources. What you want to achieve is for users to create objects of type Website that\\ncontain nothing more than the websiteâs name and the source from which the web-\\nsiteâs files (HTML, CSS, PNG, and others) should be obtained. Youâll use a Git reposi-\\ntory as the source of those files. When a user creates an instance of the Website\\nresource, you want Kubernetes to spin up a new web server pod and expose it through\\na Service, as shown in figure 18.1.\\n To create the Website resource, you want users to post manifests along the lines of\\nthe one shown in the following listing.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '513\\nDefining custom API objects\\n In general, the point of creating custom objects like this isnât always to make some-\\nthing happen when the object is created. Certain custom objects are used to store data\\ninstead of using a more generic mechanism such as a ConfigMap. Applications run-\\nning inside pods can query the API server for those objects and read whatever is\\nstored in them. \\n But in this case, we said you wanted the existence of a Website object to result in\\nthe spinning up of a web server serving the contents of the Git repository referenced\\nin the object. Weâll look at how to do that next.\\n18.1.2 Automating custom resources with custom controllers\\nTo make your Website objects run a web server pod exposed through a Service, youâll\\nneed to build and deploy a Website controller, which will watch the API server for the\\ncreation of Website objects and then create the Service and the web server Pod for\\neach of them. \\n To make sure the Pod is managed and survives node failures, the controller will\\ncreate a Deployment resource instead of an unmanaged Pod directly. The controllerâs\\noperation is summarized in figure 18.2.\\nIâve written a simple initial version of the controller, which works well enough to\\nshow CRDs and the controller in action, but itâs far from being production-ready,\\nbecause itâs overly simplified.

The proxy forwards the\\nrequest to the API server, taking care of both TLS encryption and authentication\\n(see figure 18.3).\\nThrough the connection opened by this HTTP GET request, the API server will send\\nwatch events for every change to any Website object.\\n The API server sends the ADDED watch event every time a new Website object is cre-\\nated. When the controller receives such an event, it extracts the Websiteâs name and\\nthe URL of the Git repository from the Website object it received in the watch event\\nand creates a Deployment and a Service object by posting their JSON manifests to the\\nAPI server. \\n The Deployment resource contains a template for a pod with two containers\\n(shown in figure 18.4): one running an nginx server and another one running a git-\\nsync process, which keeps a local directory synced with the contents of a Git repo.\\nThe local directory is shared with the nginx container through an emptyDir volume\\n(you did something similar to that in chapter 6, but instead of keeping the local\\ndirectory synced with a Git repo, you used a gitRepo volume to download the Git\\nrepoâs contents at pod startup; the volumeâs contents werenât kept in sync with the\\nGit repo afterward). The Service is a NodePort Service, which exposes your web\\nserver pod through a random port on each node (the same port is used on all\\nnodes). When a pod is created by the Deployment object, clients can access the web-\\nsite through the node port.\\nPod: website-controller\\nContainer: main\\nWebsite controller\\nGET http://localhost:8001/apis/extensions.\\nexample.com/v1/websites?watch=true\\nGET https://kubernetes:443/apis/extensions.\\nexample.com/v1/websites?watch=true\\nAuthorization: Bearer <token>\\nContainer: proxy\\nkubectl proxy\\nAPI server\\nFigure 18.3\\nThe Website controller talks to the API server through a proxy (in the ambassador container).\\n \\n',\n",

Users can include any field they want in the YAML of\\ntheir Website object. The API server doesnât validate the contents of the YAML (except\\nthe usual fields like apiVersion, kind, and metadata), so users can create invalid\\nWebsite objects (without a gitRepo field, for example). \\n Is it possible to add validation to the controller and prevent invalid objects from\\nbeing accepted by the API server? It isnât, because the API server first stores the object,\\nthen returns a success response to the client (kubectl), and only then notifies all the\\nwatchers (the controller is one of them). All the controller can really do is validate\\nthe object when it receives it in a watch event, and if the object is invalid, write the\\nerror message to the Website object (by updating the object through a new request to\\nthe API server). The user wouldnât be notified of the error automatically. Theyâd have\\nListing 18.7\\nThe Deployment, Service, and Pod created for the kubia-website\\n \\n',\n",

Unless\\nthe user does this, they have no way of knowing whether the object is valid or not.\\n This obviously isnât ideal. Youâd want the API server to validate the object and\\nreject invalid objects immediately. Validation of custom objects was introduced in\\nKubernetes version 1.8 as an alpha feature. To have the API server validate your cus-\\ntom objects, you need to enable the CustomResourceValidation feature gate in the\\nAPI server and specify a JSON schema in the CRD.\\n18.1.4 Providing a custom API server for your custom objects\\nA better way of adding support for custom objects in Kubernetes is to implement your\\nown API server and have the clients talk directly to it. \\nINTRODUCING API SERVER AGGREGATION\\nIn Kubernetes version 1.7, you can integrate your custom API server with the main\\nKubernetes API server, through API server aggregation. Initially, the Kubernetes API\\nserver was a single monolithic component. From Kubernetes version 1.7, multiple\\naggregated API servers will be exposed at a single location. Clients can connect to the\\naggregated API and have their requests transparently forwarded to the appropriate\\nAPI server. This way, the client wouldnât even be aware that multiple API servers han-\\ndle different objects behind the scenes. Even the core Kubernetes API server may\\neventually end up being split into multiple smaller API servers and exposed as a single\\nserver through the aggregator, as shown in figure 18.5.\\nIn your case, you could create an API server responsible for handling your Website\\nobjects. It could validate those objects the way the core Kubernetes API server validates\\nthem. Youâd no longer need to create a CRD to represent those objects, because youâd\\nimplement the Website object type into the custom API server directly. \\n Generally, each API server is responsible for storing their own resources. As shown\\nin figure 18.5, it can either run its own instance of etcd (or a whole etcd cluster), or it\\nMain\\nAPI server\\nCustom\\nAPI server Y\\nCustom\\nAPI server X\\nkubectl\\nUses its own etcd instance\\nfor storing its resources\\nUses CustomResourceDeï¬nitions\\nin main API server as storage\\nmechanism\\netcd\\netcd\\nFigure 18.5\\nAPI server aggregation\\n \\n',\n",

In that case, it needs to create a CRD object first, before creating\\ninstances of the CRD, the way you did in the example.\\nREGISTERING A CUSTOM API SERVER\\nTo add a custom API server to your cluster, youâd deploy it as a pod and expose it\\nthrough a Service. Then, to integrate it into the main API server, youâd deploy a YAML\\nmanifest describing an APIService resource like the one in the following listing.\\napiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1   \\nkind: APIService                             \\nmetadata:\\n  name: v1alpha1.extensions.example.com\\nspec:\\n  group: extensions.example.com           \\n  version: v1alpha1                      \\n  priority: 150\\n  service:                    \\n    name: website-api         \\n    namespace: default        \\nAfter creating the APIService resource from the previous listing, client requests sent\\nto the main API server that contain any resource from the extensions.example.com\\nAPI group and version v1alpha1 would be forwarded to the custom API server pod(s)\\nexposed through the website-api Service. \\nCREATING CUSTOM CLIENTS\\nWhile you can create custom resources from YAML files using the regular kubectl cli-\\nent, to make deployment of custom objects even easier, in addition to providing a cus-\\ntom API server, you can also build a custom CLI tool. This will allow you to add\\ndedicated commands for manipulating those objects, similar to how kubectl allows\\ncreating Secrets, Deployments, and other resources through resource-specific com-\\nmands like kubectl create secret or kubectl create deployment.\\n As Iâve already mentioned, custom API servers, API server aggregation, and other\\nfeatures related to extending Kubernetes are currently being worked on intensively, so\\nthey may change after the book is published. To get up-to-date information on the\\nsubject, refer to the Kubernetes GitHub repos at http:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes.\\n18.2\\nExtending Kubernetes with the Kubernetes Service \\nCatalog\\nOne of the first additional API servers that will be added to Kubernetes through API\\nserver aggregation is the Service Catalog API server. The Service Catalog is a hot topic\\nin the Kubernetes community, so you may want to know about it. \\n Currently, for a pod to consume a service (here I use the term generally, not in\\nrelation to Service resources; for example, a database service includes everything\\nListing 18.8\\nAn APIService YAML definition \\nThis is an APIService \\nresource.\\nThe API group this API \\nserver is responsible for\\nThe supported API version\\nThe Service the custom API \\nserver is exposed through\\n \\n',\n",

That someone is usually the same user\\ndeploying the client pod or, if a team is dedicated to deploying these types of general\\nservices, the user needs to file a ticket and wait for the team to provision the service.\\nThis means the user needs to either create the manifests for all the components of the\\nservice, know where to find an existing set of manifests, know how to configure it\\nproperly, and deploy it manually, or wait for the other team to do it. \\n But Kubernetes is supposed to be an easy-to-use, self-service system. Ideally, users\\nwhose apps require a certain service (for example, a web application requiring a back-\\nend database), should be able to say to Kubernetes. âHey, I need a PostgreSQL data-\\nbase. Please provision one and tell me where and how I can connect to it.â This will\\nsoon be possible through the Kubernetes Service Catalog. \\n18.2.1 Introducing the Service Catalog\\nAs the name suggests, the Service Catalog is a catalog of services. Users can browse\\nthrough the catalog and provision instances of the services listed in the catalog by\\nthemselves without having to deal with Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, and other resources\\nrequired for the service to run. Youâll recognize that this is similar to what you did\\nwith the Website custom resource.\\n Instead of adding custom resources to the API server for each type of service, the\\nService Catalog introduces the following four generic API resources:\\n\\uf0a1A ClusterServiceBroker, which describes an (external) system that can provision\\nservices\\n\\uf0a1A ClusterServiceClass, which describes a type of service that can be provisioned\\n\\uf0a1A ServiceInstance, which is one instance of a service that has been provisioned\\n\\uf0a1A ServiceBinding, which represents a binding between a set of clients (pods)\\nand a ServiceInstance\\nThe relationships between those four resources are shown in the figure 18.6 and\\nexplained in the following paragraphs.\\nIn a nutshell, a cluster admin creates a ClusterServiceBroker resource for each service\\nbroker whose services theyâd like to make available in the cluster. Kubernetes then asks\\nthe broker for a list of services that it can provide and creates a ClusterServiceClass\\nresource for each of them. When a user requires a service to be provisioned, they create\\nan ServiceInstance resource and then a ServiceBinding to bind that ServiceInstance to\\nClient pods\\nServiceBinding\\nServiceInstance\\nClusterServiceClass(es)\\nClusterServiceBroker\\nFigure 18.6\\nThe relationships between Service Catalog API resources. \\n \\n',\n",

The API is relatively simple.\\nItâs a REST API providing the following operations:\\n\\uf0a1Retrieving the list of services with GET /v2/catalog\\n\\uf0a1Provisioning a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id)\\n\\uf0a1Updating a service instance (PATCH /v2/service_instances/:id)\\n\\uf0a1Binding a service instance (PUT /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bind-\\nings/:binding_id)\\n\\uf0a1Unbinding an instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id/service_bind-\\nings/:binding_id)\\n\\uf0a1Deprovisioning a service instance (DELETE /v2/service_instances/:id)\\nYouâll find the OpenServiceBroker API spec at https:/\\n/github.com/openservicebro-\\nkerapi/servicebroker.\\nREGISTERING BROKERS IN THE SERVICE CATALOG\\nThe cluster administrator registers a broker by posting a ServiceBroker resource man-\\nifest to the Service Catalog API, like the one shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1    \\nkind: ClusterServiceBroker                                  \\nmetadata:\\n  name: database-broker                          \\nspec:\\n  url: http://database-osbapi.myorganization.org  \\nThe listing describes an imaginary broker that can provision databases of different\\ntypes. After the administrator creates the ClusterServiceBroker resource, a controller\\nin the Service Catalog Controller Manager connects to the URL specified in the\\nresource to retrieve the list of services this broker can provision.\\n After the Service Catalog retrieves the list of services, it creates a ClusterService-\\nClass resource for each of them. Each ClusterServiceClass resource describes a sin-\\ngle type of service that can be provisioned (an example of a ClusterServiceClass is\\nâPostgreSQL databaseâ). Each ClusterServiceClass has one or more service plans asso-\\nciated with it. These allow the user to choose the level of service they need (for exam-\\nple, a database ClusterServiceClass could provide a âFreeâ plan, where the size of the\\nListing 18.9\\nA ClusterServiceBroker manifest: database-broker.yaml\\nThe resource kind and \\nthe API group and version\\nThe name of this broker\\nWhere the Service Catalog\\ncan contact the broker\\n(its OpenServiceBroker [OSB] API URL)\\n \\n',\n",

Youâve inspected the\\nlist of available ClusterServiceClasses and have chosen to use the free plan of the\\npostgres-database ClusterServiceClass. \\nPROVISIONING A SERVICEINSTANCE\\nTo have the database provisioned for you, all you need to do is create a Service-\\nInstance resource, as shown in the following listing.\\napiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: ServiceInstance\\nmetadata:\\n  name: my-postgres-db                     \\nspec:\\n  clusterServiceClassName: postgres-database        \\n  clusterServicePlanName: free                             \\n  parameters:\\n    init-db-args: --data-checksums         \\nYou created a ServiceInstance called my-postgres-db (that will be the name of the\\nresource youâre deploying) and specified the ClusterServiceClass and the chosen\\nplan. Youâre also specifying a parameter, which is specific for each broker and Cluster-\\nServiceClass. Letâs imagine you looked up the possible parameters in the brokerâs doc-\\numentation.\\n As soon as you create this resource, the Service Catalog will contact the broker the\\nClusterServiceClass belongs to and ask it to provision the service. It will pass on the\\nchosen ClusterServiceClass and plan names, as well as all the parameters you specified.\\n Itâs then completely up to the broker to know what to do with this information. In\\nyour case, your database broker will probably spin up a new instance of a PostgreSQL\\ndatabase somewhereânot necessarily in the same Kubernetes cluster or even in\\nKubernetes at all. It could run a Virtual Machine and run the database in there. The\\nService Catalog doesnât care, and neither does the user requesting the service. \\n You can check if the service has been provisioned successfully by inspecting the\\nstatus section of the my-postgres-db ServiceInstance you created, as shown in the\\nfollowing listing.\\n$ kubectl get instance my-postgres-db -o yaml\\napiVersion: servicecatalog.k8s.io/v1alpha1\\nkind: ServiceInstance\\n...\\nstatus:\\n  asyncOpInProgress: false\\n  conditions:\\nListing 18.12\\nA ServiceInstance manifest: database-instance.yaml\\nListing 18.13\\nInspecting the status of a ServiceInstance\\nYouâre giving this \\nInstance a name.\\nThe ServiceClass \\nand Plan you want\\nAdditional parameters \\npassed to the broker\\n \\n',\n",

As you learned in chapter 7, the pods wonât be\\nstarted until such a Secret exists. \\n If necessary, multiple bindings can be created for different pods. The service bro-\\nker can choose to use the same set of credentials in every binding, but itâs better to\\ncreate a new set of credentials for every binding instance. This way, pods can be pre-\\nvented from using the service by deleting the ServiceBinding resource.\\n18.2.5 Unbinding and deprovisioning\\nOnce you no longer need a ServiceBinding, you can delete it the way you delete other\\nresources:\\n$ kubectl delete servicebinding my-postgres-db-binding\\nservicebinding \"my-postgres-db-binding\" deleted\\nWhen you do this, the Service Catalog controller will delete the Secret and call the bro-\\nker to perform an unbinding operation. The service instance (in your case a PostgreSQL\\ndatabase) is still running. You can therefore create a new ServiceBinding if you want.\\n But if you donât need the database instance anymore, you should delete the Service-\\nInstance resource also:\\n$ kubectl delete serviceinstance my-postgres-db\\nserviceinstance \"my-postgres-db \" deleted\\nDeleting the ServiceInstance resource causes the Service Catalog to perform a depro-\\nvisioning operation on the service broker. Again, exactly what that means is up to the\\nservice broker, but in your case, the broker should shut down the PostgreSQL data-\\nbase instance that it created when we provisioned the service instance.\\n18.2.6 Understanding what the Service Catalog brings\\nAs youâve learned, the Service Catalog enables service providers make it possible to\\nexpose those services in any Kubernetes cluster by registering the broker in that cluster.\\nListing 18.15\\nA Secret holding the credentials for connecting to the service instance\\nThis is what the pod \\nshould use to connect to \\nthe database service.\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '527\\nPlatforms built on top of Kubernetes\\nFor example, Iâve been involved with the Service Catalog since early on and have\\nimplemented a broker, which makes it trivial to provision messaging systems and\\nexpose them to pods in a Kubernetes cluster. Another team has implemented a broker\\nthat makes it easy to provision Amazon Web Services. \\n In general, service brokers allow easy provisioning and exposing of services in\\nKubernetes and will make Kubernetes an even more awesome platform for deploying\\nyour applications. \\n18.3\\nPlatforms built on top of Kubernetes\\nIâm sure youâll agree that Kubernetes is a great system by itself. Given that itâs easily\\nextensible across all its components, itâs no wonder companies that had previously\\ndeveloped their own custom platforms are now re-implementing them on top of\\nKubernetes. Kubernetes is, in fact, becoming a widely accepted foundation for the\\nnew generation of Platform-as-a-Service offerings.\\n Among the best-known PaaS systems built on Kubernetes are Deis Workflow and\\nRed Hatâs OpenShift. Weâll do a quick overview of both systems to give you a sense of\\nwhat they offer on top of all the awesome stuff Kubernetes already offers.\\n18.3.1 Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform\\nRed Hat OpenShift is a Platform-as-a-Service and as such, it has a strong focus on\\ndeveloper experience. Among its goals are enabling rapid development of applica-\\ntions, as well as easy deployment, scaling, and long-term maintenance of those apps.\\nOpenShift has been around much longer than Kubernetes. Versions 1 and 2 were\\nbuilt from the ground up and had nothing to do with Kubernetes, but when Kuberne-\\ntes was announced, Red Hat decided to rebuild OpenShift version 3 from scratchâ\\nthis time on top of Kubernetes. When a company such as Red Hat decides to throw\\naway an old version of their software and build a new one on top of an existing tech-\\nnology like Kubernetes, it should be clear to everyone how great Kubernetes is.\\n Kubernetes automates rollouts and application scaling, whereas OpenShift also auto-\\nmates the actual building of application images and their automatic deployment with-\\nout requiring you to integrate a Continuous Integration solution into your cluster. \\n OpenShift also provides user and group management, which allows you to run a\\nproperly secured multi-tenant Kubernetes cluster, where individual users are only\\nallowed to access their own Kubernetes namespaces and the apps running in those\\nnamespaces are also fully network-isolated from each other by default. \\nINTRODUCING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN OPENSHIFT\\nOpenShift provides some additional API objects in addition to all those available in\\nKubernetes. Weâll explain them in the next few paragraphs to give you a good over-\\nview of what OpenShift does and what it provides.\\n The additional resources include\\n\\uf0a1Users & Groups\\n\\uf0a1Projects\\n \\n',\n",

These features pre-date the Role-\\nBased Access Control, which is now the standard in vanilla Kubernetes.\\n Each user has access to certain Projects, which are nothing more than Kubernetes\\nNamespaces with additional annotations. Users can only act on resources that reside\\nin the projects the user has access to. Access to the project is granted by a cluster\\nadministrator. \\nINTRODUCING APPLICATION TEMPLATES\\nKubernetes makes it possible to deploy a set of resources through a single JSON or\\nYAML manifest. OpenShift takes this a step further by allowing that manifest to be\\nparameterizable. A parameterizable list in OpenShift is called a Template; itâs a list of\\nobjects whose definitions can include placeholders that get replaced with parameter\\nvalues when you process and then instantiate a template (see figure 18.8).\\nThe template itself is a JSON or YAML file containing a list of parameters that are ref-\\nerenced in resources defined in that same JSON/YAML. The template can be stored\\nin the API server like any other object. Before a template can be instantiated, it needs\\nTemplate\\nParameters\\nAPP_NAME=\"kubia\"\\nVOL_CAPACITY=\"5 Gi\"\\n...\\nPod\\nname: $(APP_NAME)\\nService\\nname: $(APP_NAME)\\nTemplate\\nPod\\nname: kubia\\nService\\nname: kubia\\nPod\\nname: kubia\\nService\\nname: kubia\\nProcess\\nCreate\\nFigure 18.8\\nOpenShift templates\\n \\n',\n",

To process a template, you supply the values for the templateâs\\nparameters and then OpenShift replaces the references to the parameters with those\\nvalues. The result is a processed template, which is exactly like a Kubernetes resource\\nlist that can then be created with a single POST request.\\n OpenShift provides a long list of pre-fabricated templates that allow users to\\nquickly run complex applications by specifying a few arguments (or none at all, if the\\ntemplate provides good defaults for those arguments). For example, a template can\\nenable the creation of all the Kubernetes resources necessary to run a Java EE appli-\\ncation inside an Application Server, which connects to a back-end database, also\\ndeployed as part of that same template. All those components can be deployed with a\\nsingle command.\\nBUILDING IMAGES FROM SOURCE USING BUILDCONFIGS\\nOne of the best features of OpenShift is the ability to have OpenShift build and imme-\\ndiately deploy an application in the OpenShift cluster by pointing it to a Git repository\\nholding the applicationâs source code. You donât need to build the container image at\\nallâOpenShift does that for you. This is done by creating a resource called Build-\\nConfig, which can be configured to trigger builds of container images immediately\\nafter a change is committed to the source Git repository. \\n Although OpenShift doesnât monitor the Git repository itself, a hook in the repos-\\nitory can notify OpenShift of the new commit. OpenShift will then pull the changes\\nfrom the Git repository and start the build process. A build mechanism called Source\\nTo Image can detect what type of application is in the Git repository and run the\\nproper build procedure for it. For example, if it detects a pom.xml file, which is used\\nin Java Maven-formatted projects, it runs a Maven build. The resulting artifacts are\\npackaged into an appropriate container image, and are then pushed to an internal\\ncontainer registry (provided by OpenShift). From there, they can be pulled and run\\nin the cluster immediately. \\n By creating a BuildConfig object, developers can thus point to a Git repo and not\\nworry about building container images. Developers have almost no need to know\\nanything about containers. Once the ops team deploys an OpenShift cluster and\\ngives developers access to it, those developers can develop their code, commit, and\\npush it to a Git repo, the same way they used to before we started packaging apps into\\ncontainers. Then OpenShift takes care of building, deploying, and managing apps\\nfrom that code.\\nAUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYING NEWLY BUILT IMAGES WITH DEPLOYMENTCONFIGS\\nOnce a new container image is built, it can also automatically be deployed in the clus-\\nter. This is enabled by creating a DeploymentConfig object and pointing it to an\\nImageStream. As the name suggests, an ImageStream is a stream of images. When an\\nimage is built, itâs added to the ImageStream. This enables the DeploymentConfig to\\nnotice the newly built image and allows it to take action and initiate a rollout of the\\nnew image (see figure 18.9).\\n \\n',\n",

In contrast to a\\nKubernetes Deployment, it creates ReplicationControllers instead of ReplicaSets and\\nprovides a few additional features.\\nEXPOSING SERVICES EXTERNALLY USING ROUTES\\nEarly on, Kubernetes didnât provide Ingress objects.

A Route is sim-\\nilar to an Ingress, but it provides additional configuration related to TLS termination\\nand traffic splitting. \\n Similar to an Ingress controller, a Route needs a Router, which is a controller that\\nprovides the load balancer or proxy.

Weâll take a\\nbrief look at both.\\nINTRODUCING DEIS WORKFLOW\\nYou can deploy Deis Workflow to any existing Kubernetes cluster (unlike OpenShift,\\nwhich is a complete cluster with a modified API server and other Kubernetes compo-\\nnents). When you run Workflow, it creates a set of Services and ReplicationControllers,\\nwhich then provide developers with a simple, developer-friendly environment. \\n Deploying new versions of your app is triggered by pushing your changes with git\\npush deis master and letting Workflow take care of the rest. Similar to OpenShift,\\nWorkflow also provides a source to image mechanism, application rollouts and roll-\\nbacks, edge routing, and also log aggregation, metrics, and alerting, which arenât\\navailable in core Kubernetes. \\n To run Workflow in your Kubernetes cluster, you first need to install the Deis Work-\\nflow and Helm CLI tools and then install Workflow into your cluster. We wonât go into\\nhow to do that here, but if youâd like to learn more, visit the website at https:/\\n/deis\\n.com/workflow. What weâll explore here is the Helm tool, which can be used without\\nWorkflow and has gained popularity in the community.\\nDEPLOYING RESOURCES THROUGH HELM\\nHelm is a package manager for Kubernetes (similar to OS package managers like yum\\nor apt in Linux or homebrew in MacOS). \\n Helm is comprised of two things:\\n\\uf0a1A helm CLI tool (the client).\\n\\uf0a1Tiller, a server component running as a Pod inside the Kubernetes cluster.\\nThose two components are used to deploy and manage application packages in a\\nKubernetes cluster. Helm application packages are called Charts. Theyâre combined\\nwith a Config, which contains configuration information and is merged into a Chart\\nto create a Release, which is a running instance of an application (a combined Chart\\nand Config). You deploy and manage Releases using the helm CLI tool, which talks to\\nthe Tiller server, which is the component that creates all the necessary Kubernetes\\nresources defined in the Chart, as shown in figure 18.10.\\n You can create charts yourself and keep them on your local disk, or you can use\\nany existing chart, which is available in the growing list of helm charts maintained by\\nthe community at https:/\\n/github.com/kubernetes/charts. The list includes charts for\\napplications such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Magento, Memcached, MongoDB,\\nOpenVPN, PHPBB, RabbitMQ, Redis, WordPress, and others.\\n Similar to how you donât build and install apps developed by other people to your\\nLinux system manually, you probably donât want to build and manage your own\\nKubernetes manifests for such applications, right? Thatâs why youâll want to use Helm\\nand the charts available in the GitHub repository I mentioned. \\n \\n',\n",

The name is used to refer to the context,\\nuser, or cluster. \\nCLUSTERS\\nA cluster entry represents a Kubernetes cluster and contains the URL of the API\\nserver, the certificate authority (CA) file, and possibly a few other configuration\\noptions related to communication with the API server. The CA certificate can be\\nstored in a separate file and referenced in the kubeconfig file, or it can be included in\\nit directly in the certificate-authority-data field.\\nUSERS\\nEach user defines the credentials to use when talking to an API server. This can be a\\nusername and password pair, an authentication token, or a client key and certificate.\\nThe certificate and key can be included in the kubeconfig file (through the client-\\ncertificate-data and client-key-data properties) or stored in separate files and\\nreferenced in the config file, as shown in listing A.1.\\nCONTEXTS\\nA context ties together a cluster, a user, and the default namespace kubectl should use\\nwhen performing commands. Multiple contexts can point to the same user or cluster. \\nTHE CURRENT CONTEXT\\nWhile there can be multiple contexts defined in the kubeconfig file, at any given time\\nonly one of them is the current context. Later weâll see how the current context can\\nbe changed.\\nA.2.3\\nListing, adding, and modifying kube config entries\\nYou can edit the file manually to add, modify, and remove clusters, users, or contexts,\\nbut you can also do it through one of the kubectl config commands.\\nADDING OR MODIFYING A CLUSTER\\nTo add another cluster, use the kubectl config set-cluster command:\\n$ kubectl config set-cluster my-other-cluster \\nâ¥ --server=https://k8s.example.com:6443 \\nâ¥ --certificate-authority=path/to/the/cafile\\nThis will add a cluster called my-other-cluster with the API server located at https:/\\n/\\nk8s.example.com:6443. To see additional options you can pass to the command, run\\nkubectl config set-cluster to have it print out usage examples.\\n If a cluster by that name already exists, the set-cluster command will overwrite\\nits configuration options. \\nADDING OR MODIFYING USER CREDENTIALS\\nAdding and modifying users is similar to adding or modifying a cluster. To add a user\\nthat authenticates with the API server using a username and password, run the follow-\\ning command:\\n$ kubectl config set-credentials foo --username=foo --password=pass\\n \\n',\n",

If you use the same\\ncredentials for authenticating against different clusters, you can define a single user\\nand use it with both clusters. \\nTYING CLUSTERS AND USER CREDENTIALS TOGETHER\\nA context defines which user to use with which cluster, but can also define the name-\\nspace that kubectl should use, when you donât specify the namespace explicitly with\\nthe --namespace or -n option.\\n The following command is used to create a new context that ties together the clus-\\nter and the user you created:\\n$ kubectl config set-context some-context --cluster=my-other-cluster \\nâ¥ --user=foo --namespace=bar\\nThis creates a context called some-context that uses the my-other-cluster cluster\\nand the foo user credentials. The default namespace in this context is set to bar. \\n You can also use the same command to change the namespace of your current\\ncontext, for example. You can get the name of the current context like so:\\n$ kubectl config current-context\\nminikube\\nYou then change the namespace like this:\\n$ kubectl config set-context minikube --namespace=another-namespace\\nRunning this simple command once is much more user-friendly compared to having\\nto include the --namespace option every time you run kubectl.\\nTIP\\nTo easily switch between namespaces, define an alias like this: alias\\nkcd='kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context)\\n--namespace '. You can then switch between namespaces with kcd some-\\nnamespace.\\nA.2.4\\nUsing kubectl with different clusters, users, and contexts\\nWhen you run kubectl commands, the cluster, user, and namespace defined in the\\nkubeconfigâs current context are used, but you can override them using the following\\ncommand-line options:\\nâ \\n--user to use a different user from the kubeconfig file.\\nâ \\n--username and --password to use a different username and/or password (they\\ndonât need to be specified in the config file).

It has also deployed the kube-\\nproxy, making Kubernetes services available from the master node. \\nB.2.1\\nUnderstanding how kubeadm runs the components\\nAll these components are running as containers. You can use the docker ps command\\nto confirm this. But kubeadm doesnât use Docker directly to run them. It deploys their\\nYAML descriptors to the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory. This directory is moni-\\ntored by the Kubelet, which then runs these components through Docker. The com-\\nponents run as Pods. You can see them with the kubectl get command. But first, you\\nneed to configure kubectl.\\nRUNNING KUBECTL ON THE MASTER\\nYou installed kubectl along with docker, kubeadm, and other packages in one of the\\ninitial steps. But you canât use kubectl to talk to your cluster without first configuring\\nit through a kubeconfig file.\\n Luckily, the necessary configuration is stored in the /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf\\nfile. All you need to do is make kubectl use it by setting the KUBECONFIG environment\\nvariable, as explained in appendix A:\\n# export KUBECONFIG=/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf\\nLISTING THE PODS\\nTo test kubectl, you can list the pods of the Control Plane (theyâre in the kube-system\\nnamespace), as shown in the following listing.\\n# kubectl get po -n kube-system\\nNAME                                 READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\\netcd-master.k8s                      1/1       Running   0          21m\\nkube-apiserver-master.k8s            1/1       Running   0          22m\\nkube-controller-manager-master.k8s   1/1       Running   0          21m\\nkube-dns-3913472980-cn6kz            0/3       Pending   0          22m\\nkube-proxy-qb709                     1/1       Running   0          22m\\nkube-scheduler-master.k8s            1/1       Running   0          21m\\nLISTING NODES\\nYouâre finished with setting up the master, but you still need to set up the nodes.\\nAlthough you already installed the Kubelet on both of your two worker nodes (you\\neither installed each node separately or cloned the initial VM after you installed all\\nthe required packages), they arenât part of your Kubernetes cluster yet.

Like Docker, it\\nruns applications in isolated containers, using the same Linux technologies as\\nthose used by Docker. Letâs look at how rkt differs from Docker and how to try it in\\nMinikube.\\n The first great thing about rkt is that it directly supports the notion of a Pod\\n(running multiple related containers), unlike Docker, which only runs individual\\ncontainers. Rkt is based on open standards and was built with security in mind from\\nthe start (for example, images are signed, so you can be sure they havenât been tam-\\npered with). Unlike Docker, which initially had a client-server based architecture\\nthat didnât play well with init systems such as systemd, rkt is a CLI tool that runs\\nyour container directly, instead of telling a daemon to run it. A nice thing about rkt\\nis that it can run existing Docker-formatted container images, so you donât need to\\nrepackage your applications to get started with rkt.\\nC.1.1\\nConfiguring Kubernetes to use rkt\\nAs you may remember from chapter 11, the Kubelet is the only Kubernetes\\ncomponent that talks to the Container Runtime. To get Kubernetes to use rkt\\ninstead of Docker, you need to configure the Kubelet to use it by running it with\\nthe --container-runtime=rkt command-line option. But be aware that support\\nfor rkt isnât as mature as support for Docker. \\n Please refer to the Kubernetes documentation for more information on how to\\nuse rkt and what is or isnât supported. Here, weâll go over a quick example to get\\nyou started.\\n \\n',\n",

To use rkt as the container runtime in Minikube, all you\\nneed to do is start Minikube with the following two options:\\n$ minikube start --container-runtime=rkt --network-plugin=cni \\nNOTE\\nYou may need to run minikube delete to delete the existing Minikube\\nVM first. \\nThe --container-runtime=rkt option obviously configures the Kubelet to use rkt as\\nthe Container Runtime, whereas the --network-plugin=cni makes it use the Con-\\ntainer Network Interface as the network plugin. Without this option, pods wonât run,\\nso itâs imperative you use it.\\nRUNNING A POD\\nOnce the Minikube VM is up, you can interact with Kubernetes exactly like before.\\nYou can deploy the kubia app with the kubectl run command, for example:\\n$ kubectl run kubia --image=luksa/kubia --port 8080\\ndeployment \"kubia\" created\\nWhen the pod starts up, you can see itâs running through rkt by inspecting its contain-\\ners with kubectl describe, as shown in the following listing.\\n$ kubectl describe pods\\nName:           kubia-3604679414-l1nn3\\n...\\nStatus:         Running\\nIP:             10.1.0.2\\nControllers:    ReplicaSet/kubia-3604679414\\nContainers:\\n  kubia:\\n    Container ID:       rkt://87a138ce-...-96e375852997:kubia    \\n    Image:              luksa/kubia\\n    Image ID:           rkt://sha512-5bbc5c7df6148d30d74e0...    \\n...\\nYou can also try hitting the podâs HTTP port to see if itâs responding properly to\\nHTTP requests.

Thatâs because they\\nbelong to the same pod as the kubedns container listed above them. \\n Rkt prints containers belonging to the same pod grouped together. Each pod\\n(instead of each container) has its own UUID and state. If you tried doing this when\\nyou were using Docker as the Container Runtime, youâll appreciate how much easier\\nit is to see all the pods and their containers with rkt.

You may find it surprising thatâs no longer the case.\\n New CRI implementations are being developed that allow Kubernetes to run apps\\nin virtual machines instead of in containers. One such implementation, called Frakti,\\nallows you to run regular Docker-based container images directly through a hypervi-\\nsor, which means each container runs its own kernel. This allows much better isola-\\ntion between containers compared to when they use the same kernel. \\n And thereâs more. Another CRI implementation is the Mirantis Virtlet, which\\nmakes it possible to run actual VM images (in the QCOW2 image file format, which is\\none of the formats used by the QEMU virtual machine tool) instead of container\\nimages. When you use the Virtlet as the CRI plugin, Kubernetes spins up a VM for\\neach pod. How awesome is that?\\n \\n',\n",

But what if the whole datacenter goes dark?\\n To make sure youâre not susceptible to datacenter-wide outages, apps should be\\ndeployed in multiple datacenters or cloud availability zones. When one of those\\ndatacenters or availability zones becomes unavailable, client requests can be routed\\nto the apps running in the remaining healthy datacenters or zones.\\n While Kubernetes doesnât require you to run the Control Plane and the nodes\\nin the same datacenter, youâll almost always want to do that to keep network latency\\nbetween them low and to reduce the possibility of them becoming disconnected\\nfrom each other.

It allows users to deploy and manage apps across mul-\\ntiple clusters running in different locations in the world, but also across different\\ncloud providers combined with on-premises clusters (hybrid cloud). The motiva-\\ntion for Cluster Federation isnât only to ensure high availability, but also to com-\\nbine multiple heterogeneous clusters into a single super-cluster managed through\\na single management interface. \\n For example, by combining an on-premises cluster with one running on a cloud\\nproviderâs infrastructure, you can run privacy-sensitive components of your applica-\\ntion system on-premises, while the non-sensitive parts can run in the cloud.\\nAnother example is initially running your application only in a small on-premises\\ncluster, but when the applicationâs compute requirements exceed the clusterâs\\n \\n',\n",

       "  'text': '559\\nUnderstanding federated API objects\\nD.3.2\\nUnderstanding what federated resources do\\nFor part of the federated objects, when you create the object in the Federation API\\nserver, the controllers running in the Federation Controller Manager will create regu-\\nlar cluster-scoped resources in all underlying Kubernetes clusters and manage them\\nuntil the federated object is deleted. \\n For certain federated resource types, the resources created in the underlying clus-\\nters are exact replicas of the federated resource; for others, theyâre slightly modified\\nversions, whereas certain federated resources donât cause anything to be created in\\nthe underlying clusters at all. The replicas are kept in sync with the original federated\\nversions. But the synchronization is one-directional onlyâfrom the federation server\\ndown to the underlying clusters. If you modify the resource in an underlying cluster,\\nthe changes will not be synced up to the Federation API server.\\n For example, if you create a namespace in the federated API server, a namespace\\nwith the same name will be created in all underlying clusters. If you then create a fed-\\nerated ConfigMap inside that namespace, a ConfigMap with that exact name and con-\\ntents will be created in all underlying clusters, in the same namespace. This also applies\\nto Secrets, Services, and DaemonSets.\\n ReplicaSets and Deployments are different. They arenât blindly copied to the\\nunderlying clusters, because thatâs not what the user usually wants. After all, if you cre-\\nate a Deployment with a desired replica count of 10, you probably donât want 10 pod\\nreplicas running in each underlying cluster. You want 10 replicas in total. Because of\\nthis, when you specify a desired replica count in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, the Fed-\\neration controllers create underlying Deployments/ReplicaSets so that the sum of\\ntheir desired replica counts equals the desired replica count specified in the federated\\nDeployment or ReplicaSet. By default, the replicas are spread evenly across the clus-\\nters, but this can be overridden.\\nNOTE\\nCurrently, you need to connect to each clusterâs API server individu-\\nally to get the list of pods running in that cluster. You canât list all the clustersâ\\npods through the Federated API server.\\nA federated Ingress resource, on the other hand, doesnât result in the creation of any\\nIngress objects in the underlying clusters. You may remember from chapter 5 that an\\nIngress represents a single point of entry for external clients to a Service. Because of\\nthis, a federated Ingress resource creates a global, multi-cluster-wide entry point to the\\nServices across all underlying clusters. \\nNOTE\\nAs for regular Ingresses, a federated Ingress controller is required\\nfor this. \\nSetting up federated Kubernetes clusters is outside the scope of this book, so you can\\nlearn more about the subject by referring to the Cluster Federation sections in the\\nuser and administration guides in the Kubernetes online documentation at http:/\\n/\\nkubernetes.io/docs/.\\n \\n',\n",
