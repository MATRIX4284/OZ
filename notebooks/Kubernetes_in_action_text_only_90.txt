CHAPTER 3
Pods: running containers in Kubernetes
For example, the main container in a pod could be a web server that serves files from
a certain file directory, while an additional container (a sidecar container) periodi-
cally downloads content from an external source and stores it in the web server’s
directory. In chapter 6 you’ll see that you need to use a Kubernetes Volume that you
mount into both containers. 
 Other examples of sidecar containers include log rotators and collectors, data pro-
cessors, communication adapters, and others.
DECIDING WHEN TO USE MULTIPLE CONTAINERS IN A POD
To recap how containers should be grouped into pods—when deciding whether to
put two containers into a single pod or into two separate pods, you always need to ask
yourself the following questions:
Do they need to be run together or can they run on different hosts?
Do they represent a single whole or are they independent components?
Must they be scaled together or individually? 
Basically, you should always gravitate toward running containers in separate pods,
unless a specific reason requires them to be part of the same pod. Figure 3.4 will help
you memorize this.
Although pods can contain multiple containers, to keep things simple for now, you’ll
only be dealing with single-container pods in this chapter. You’ll see how multiple
containers are used in the same pod later, in chapter 6.

A container shouldn’t run multiple processes. A pod shouldn’t contain multiple 
containers if they don’t need to run on the same machine.
