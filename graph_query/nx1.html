The ops people don\u2019t want to deal with the\nimplicit interdependencies of all the application components and don\u2019t want to think\nabout how changes to either the underlying operating system or the infrastructure\ncan affect the operation of the application as a whole, but they must.\n Ideally, you want the developers to deploy applications themselves without know-\ning anything about the hardware infrastructure and without dealing with the ops\nteam. This is referred to as NoOps. Obviously, you still need someone to take care of\nthe hardware infrastructure, but ideally, without having to deal with peculiarities of\neach application running on it. \n As you\u2019ll see, Kubernetes enables us to achieve all of this. By abstracting away the\nactual hardware and exposing it as a single platform for deploying and running apps,\nit allows developers to configure and deploy their applications without any help from\nthe sysadmins and allows the sysadmins to focus on keeping the underlying infrastruc-\nture up and running, while not having to know anything about the actual applications\nrunning on top of it.\n1.2\nIntroducing container technologies\nIn section 1.1 I presented a non-comprehensive list of problems facing today\u2019s devel-\nopment and ops teams.

Two mechanisms make this possible.\nThe first one, Linux Namespaces, makes sure each process sees its own personal view of\nthe system (files, processes, network interfaces, hostname, and so on). The second\none is Linux Control Groups (cgroups), which limit the amount of resources the process\ncan consume (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, and so on).\nISOLATING PROCESSES WITH LINUX NAMESPACES\nBy default, each Linux system initially has one single namespace. All system resources,\nsuch as filesystems, process IDs, user IDs, network interfaces, and others, belong to the\nsingle namespace. But you can create additional namespaces and organize resources\nacross them. When running a process, you run it inside one of those namespaces. The\nprocess will only see resources that are inside the same namespace. Well, multiple\nkinds of namespaces exist, so a process doesn\u2019t belong to one namespace, but to one\nnamespace of each kind. \n The following kinds of namespaces exist:\n\uf0a1Mount (mnt)\n\uf0a1Process ID (pid)\n\uf0a1Network (net)\n\uf0a1Inter-process communication (ipc)\n\uf0a1UTS\n\uf0a1User ID (user)\nEach namespace kind is used to isolate a certain group of resources. For example, the\nUTS namespace determines what hostname and domain name the process running\ninside that namespace sees. By assigning two different UTS namespaces to a pair of\nprocesses, you can make them see different local hostnames. In other words, to the\ntwo processes, it will appear as though they are running on two different machines (at\nleast as far as the hostname is concerned). \n Likewise, what Network namespace a process belongs to determines which net-\nwork interfaces the application running inside the process sees. Each network inter-\nface belongs to exactly one namespace, but can be moved from one namespace to\nanother. Each container uses its own Network namespace, and therefore each con-\ntainer sees its own set of network interfaces.\n This should give you a basic idea of how namespaces are used to isolate applica-\ntions running in containers from each other. \nLIMITING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO A PROCESS\nThe other half of container isolation deals with limiting the amount of system\nresources a container can consume. This is achieved with cgroups, a Linux kernel fea-\nture that limits the resource usage of a process (or a group of processes).

Docker was the\nfirst container system that made containers easily portable across different machines.\nIt simplified the process of packaging up not only the application but also all its\nlibraries and other dependencies, even the whole OS file system, into a simple, por-\ntable package that can be used to provision the application to any other machine\nrunning Docker. \n When you run an application packaged with Docker, it sees the exact filesystem\ncontents that you\u2019ve bundled with it.

Only the kernel may be different.\n This is similar to creating a VM image by installing an operating system into a VM,\ninstalling the app inside it, and then distributing the whole VM image around and\nrunning it.

This can be either a few libraries that the app requires or even all the files\nthat are usually available on the filesystem of an installed operating system.

There-\nfore, even if they share files, they\u2019re still isolated from each other. This works because\ncontainer image layers are read-only. When a container is run, a new writable layer is\ncreated on top of the layers in the image. When the process in the container writes to\na file located in one of the underlying layers, a copy of the whole file is created in the\ntop-most layer and the process writes to the copy. \nUNDERSTANDING THE PORTABILITY LIMITATIONS OF CONTAINER IMAGES\nIn theory, a container image can be run on any Linux machine running Docker, but\none small caveat exists\u2014one related to the fact that all containers running on a host use\nthe host\u2019s Linux kernel. If a containerized application requires a specific kernel version,\nit may not work on every machine. If a machine runs a different version of the Linux\nkernel or doesn\u2019t have the same kernel modules available, the app can\u2019t run on it.\n While containers are much more lightweight compared to VMs, they impose cer-\ntain constraints on the apps running inside them. VMs have no such constraints,\nbecause each VM runs its own kernel. \n And it\u2019s not only about the kernel. It should also be clear that a containerized app\nbuilt for a specific hardware architecture can only run on other machines that have\nthe same architecture.

You can look it up\nthrough the DOCKER_HOST environment variable.\nACCESSING YOUR APP\nNow try to access your application at http:/\n/localhost:8080 (be sure to replace local-\nhost with the hostname or IP of the Docker host if necessary): \n$ curl localhost:8080\nYou\u2019ve hit 44d76963e8e1   \nThat\u2019s the response from your app. Your tiny application is now running inside a con-\ntainer, isolated from everything else.

On Windows, you can download the file manually, rename it to minikube.exe,\nand put it onto your path. Minikube runs Kubernetes inside a VM run through either\nVirtualBox or KVM, so you also need to install one of them before you can start the\nMinikube cluster.\nSTARTING A KUBERNETES CLUSTER WITH MINIKUBE\nOnce you have Minikube installed locally, you can immediately start up the Kuberne-\ntes cluster with the command in the following listing.\n$ minikube start\nStarting local Kubernetes cluster...\nStarting VM...\nSSH-ing files into VM...\n...\nKubectl is now configured to use the cluster. \nListing 2.10\nStarting a Minikube virtual machine\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "37\nSetting up a Kubernetes cluster\ncluster using virtual machines, but I suggest you try it only after reading the first 11\nchapters of the book.\n Another option is to install Kubernetes on Amazon\u2019s AWS (Amazon Web Services).\nFor this, you can look at the kops tool, which is built on top of kubeadm mentioned in\nthe previous paragraph, and is available at http:/\n/github.com/kubernetes/kops.

For OSX, this is what the command looks like:\n$ curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/\n\u27a5 v0.23.0/minikube-darwin-amd64 \u0026\u0026 chmod +x minikube \u0026\u0026 sudo mv minikube \n\u27a5 /usr/local/bin/\nOn Linux, you download a different release (replace \u201cdarwin\u201d with \u201clinux\u201d in the\nURL). On Windows, you can download the file manually, rename it to minikube.exe,\nand put it onto your path. Minikube runs Kubernetes inside a VM run through either\nVirtualBox or KVM, so you also need to install one of them before you can start the\nMinikube cluster.\nSTARTING A KUBERNETES CLUSTER WITH MINIKUBE\nOnce you have Minikube installed locally, you can immediately start up the Kuberne-\ntes cluster with the command in the following listing.\n$ minikube start\nStarting local Kubernetes cluster...\nStarting VM...\nSSH-ing files into VM...\n...\nKubectl is now configured to use the cluster. \nListing 2.10\nStarting a Minikube virtual machine\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag67", "label": "table_flag67", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_68", "label": "38\nCHAPTER 2\nFirst steps with Docker and Kubernetes\nStarting the cluster takes more than a minute, so don\u2019t interrupt the command before\nit completes. \nINSTALLING THE KUBERNETES CLIENT (KUBECTL)\nTo interact with Kubernetes, you also need the kubectl CLI client. Again, all you need\nto do is download it and put it on your path. The latest stable release for OSX, for\nexample, can be downloaded and installed with the following command:\n$ curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\n\u27a5  /$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release\n\u27a5  /stable.txt)/bin/darwin/amd64/kubectl \n\u27a5  \u0026\u0026 chmod +x kubectl \n\u27a5  \u0026\u0026 sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/\nTo download kubectl for Linux or Windows, replace darwin in the URL with either\nlinux or windows.\nNOTE\nIf you\u2019ll be using multiple Kubernetes clusters (for example, both\nMinikube and GKE), refer to appendix A for information on how to set up\nand switch between different kubectl contexts.\nCHECKING TO SEE THE CLUSTER IS UP AND KUBECTL CAN TALK TO IT\nTo verify your cluster is working, you can use the kubectl cluster-info command\nshown in the following listing.\n$ kubectl cluster-info\nKubernetes master is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443\nKubeDNS is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/proxy/...\nkubernetes-dashboard is running at https://192.168.99.100:8443/api/v1/...\nThis shows the cluster is up.

Maybe something such as kubectl get containers? Well, that\u2019s not exactly\nhow Kubernetes works. It doesn\u2019t deal with individual containers directly. Instead, it\nuses the concept of multiple co-located containers. This group of containers is called\na Pod. \n A pod is a group of one or more tightly related containers that will always run\ntogether on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace(s). Each pod\nis like a separate logical machine with its own IP, hostname, processes, and so on,\nrunning a single application. The application can be a single process, running in a\nsingle container, or it can be a main application process and additional supporting\nprocesses, each running in its own container. All the containers in a pod will appear\nto be running on the same logical machine, whereas containers in other pods, even\nif they\u2019re running on the same worker node, will appear to be running on a differ-\nent one. \n To better understand the relationship between containers, pods, and nodes, exam-\nine figure 2.5.

Maybe something such as kubectl get containers? Well, that\u2019s not exactly\nhow Kubernetes works. It doesn\u2019t deal with individual containers directly. Instead, it\nuses the concept of multiple co-located containers. This group of containers is called\na Pod. \n A pod is a group of one or more tightly related containers that will always run\ntogether on the same worker node and in the same Linux namespace(s). Each pod\nis like a separate logical machine with its own IP, hostname, processes, and so on,\nrunning a single application. The application can be a single process, running in a\nsingle container, or it can be a main application process and additional supporting\nprocesses, each running in its own container. All the containers in a pod will appear\nto be running on the same logical machine, whereas containers in other pods, even\nif they\u2019re running on the same worker node, will appear to be running on a differ-\nent one. \n To better understand the relationship between containers, pods, and nodes, exam-\nine figure 2.5.

It contains only a\nsingle container, but generally a pod can contain as many containers as you want.\nInside the container is your Node.js process, which is bound to port 8080 and is wait-\ning for HTTP requests. The pod has its own unique private IP address and hostname. \nUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\nThe next component is the kubia ReplicationController. It makes sure there\u2019s always\nexactly one instance of your pod running. Generally, ReplicationControllers are used\nto replicate pods (that is, create multiple copies of a pod) and keep them running. In\nyour case, you didn\u2019t specify how many pod replicas you want, so the Replication-\nController created a single one. If your pod were to disappear for any reason, the\nReplicationController would create a new pod to replace the missing one. \nUNDERSTANDING WHY YOU NEED A SERVICE\nThe third component of your system is the kubia-http service. To understand why\nyou need services, you need to learn a key detail about pods. They\u2019re ephemeral. A\npod may disappear at any time\u2014because the node it\u2019s running on has failed, because\nsomeone deleted the pod, or because the pod was evicted from an otherwise healthy\nnode. When any of those occurs, a missing pod is replaced with a new one by the\nReplicationController, as described previously. This new pod gets a different IP\naddress from the pod it\u2019s replacing. This is where services come in\u2014to solve the prob-\nlem of ever-changing pod IP addresses, as well as exposing multiple pods at a single\nconstant IP and port pair. \n When a service is created, it gets a static IP, which never changes during the lifetime of\nthe service. Instead of connecting to pods directly, clients should connect to the service\nthrough its constant IP address. The service makes sure one of the pods receives the con-\nnection, regardless of where the pod is currently running (and what its IP address is). \n Services represent a static location for a group of one or more pods that all provide\nthe same service. Requests coming to the IP and port of the service will be forwarded\nto the IP and port of one of the pods belonging to the service at that moment.  \n2.3.4\nHorizontally scaling the application\nYou now have a running application, monitored and kept running by a Replication-\nController and exposed to the world through a service. Now let\u2019s make additional\nmagic happen. \n One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can\nscale your deployments. Let\u2019s see how easy it is to scale up the number of pods. You\u2019ll\nincrease the number of running instances to three. \n Your pod is managed by a ReplicationController. Let\u2019s see it with the kubectl get\ncommand:\n$ kubectl get replicationcontrollers\nNAME        DESIRED    CURRENT   AGE\nkubia       1          1         17m\n \nwww.allitebooks.com\n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "48\nCHAPTER 2\nFirst steps with Docker and Kubernetes\nUNDERSTANDING THE POD AND ITS CONTAINER\nThe main and most important component in your system is the pod. It contains only a\nsingle container, but generally a pod can contain as many containers as you want.\nInside the container is your Node.js process, which is bound to port 8080 and is wait-\ning for HTTP requests. The pod has its own unique private IP address and hostname. \nUNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF THE REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\nThe next component is the kubia ReplicationController. It makes sure there\u2019s always\nexactly one instance of your pod running. Generally, ReplicationControllers are used\nto replicate pods (that is, create multiple copies of a pod) and keep them running. In\nyour case, you didn\u2019t specify how many pod replicas you want, so the Replication-\nController created a single one. If your pod were to disappear for any reason, the\nReplicationController would create a new pod to replace the missing one. \nUNDERSTANDING WHY YOU NEED A SERVICE\nThe third component of your system is the kubia-http service. To understand why\nyou need services, you need to learn a key detail about pods. They\u2019re ephemeral. A\npod may disappear at any time\u2014because the node it\u2019s running on has failed, because\nsomeone deleted the pod, or because the pod was evicted from an otherwise healthy\nnode. When any of those occurs, a missing pod is replaced with a new one by the\nReplicationController, as described previously. This new pod gets a different IP\naddress from the pod it\u2019s replacing. This is where services come in\u2014to solve the prob-\nlem of ever-changing pod IP addresses, as well as exposing multiple pods at a single\nconstant IP and port pair. \n When a service is created, it gets a static IP, which never changes during the lifetime of\nthe service. Instead of connecting to pods directly, clients should connect to the service\nthrough its constant IP address. The service makes sure one of the pods receives the con-\nnection, regardless of where the pod is currently running (and what its IP address is). \n Services represent a static location for a group of one or more pods that all provide\nthe same service. Requests coming to the IP and port of the service will be forwarded\nto the IP and port of one of the pods belonging to the service at that moment.  \n2.3.4\nHorizontally scaling the application\nYou now have a running application, monitored and kept running by a Replication-\nController and exposed to the world through a service. Now let\u2019s make additional\nmagic happen. \n One of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the simplicity with which you can\nscale your deployments.

That\u2019s how Docker\nand Kubernetes are meant to be used. \n3.1.2\nUnderstanding pods\nBecause you\u2019re not supposed to group multiple processes into a single container, it\u2019s\nobvious you need another higher-level construct that will allow you to bind containers\ntogether and manage them as a single unit. This is the reasoning behind pods. \n A pod of containers allows you to run closely related processes together and pro-\nvide them with (almost) the same environment as if they were all running in a single\ncontainer, while keeping them somewhat isolated. This way, you get the best of both\nworlds. You can take advantage of all the features containers provide, while at the\nsame time giving the processes the illusion of running together. \nUNDERSTANDING THE PARTIAL ISOLATION BETWEEN CONTAINERS OF THE SAME POD\nIn the previous chapter, you learned that containers are completely isolated from\neach other, but now you see that you want to isolate groups of containers instead of\nindividual ones. You want containers inside each group to share certain resources,\nalthough not all, so that they\u2019re not fully isolated. Kubernetes achieves this by config-\nuring Docker to have all containers of a pod share the same set of Linux namespaces\ninstead of each container having its own set. \n Because all containers of a pod run under the same Network and UTS namespaces\n(we\u2019re talking about Linux namespaces here), they all share the same hostname and\nnetwork interfaces. Similarly, all containers of a pod run under the same IPC namespace\nand can communicate through IPC. In the latest Kubernetes and Docker versions, they\ncan also share the same PID namespace, but that feature isn\u2019t enabled by default. \nNOTE\nWhen containers of the same pod use separate PID namespaces, you\nonly see the container\u2019s own processes when running ps aux in the container.\nBut when it comes to the filesystem, things are a little different. Because most of the\ncontainer\u2019s filesystem comes from the container image, by default, the filesystem of\neach container is fully isolated from other containers. However, it\u2019s possible to have\nthem share file directories using a Kubernetes concept called a Volume, which we\u2019ll\ntalk about in chapter 6.\nUNDERSTANDING HOW CONTAINERS SHARE THE SAME IP AND PORT SPACE\nOne thing to stress here is that because containers in a pod run in the same Network\nnamespace, they share the same IP address and port space. This means processes run-\nning in containers of the same pod need to take care not to bind to the same port\nnumbers or they\u2019ll run into port conflicts. But this only concerns containers in the\nsame pod. Containers of different pods can never run into port conflicts, because\neach pod has a separate port space.

The status\npart contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given\nmoment. When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part. \n The three parts described previously show the typical structure of a Kubernetes\nAPI object. As you\u2019ll see throughout the book, all other objects have the same anat-\nomy. This makes understanding new objects relatively easy.\n Going through all the individual properties in the previous YAML doesn\u2019t make\nmuch sense, so, instead, let\u2019s see what the most basic YAML for creating a pod looks\nlike. \n3.2.2\nCreating a simple YAML descriptor for a pod\nYou\u2019re going to create a file called kubia-manual.yaml (you can create it in any\ndirectory you want), or download the book\u2019s code archive, where you\u2019ll find the\nfile inside the Chapter03 directory.

Let\u2019s exam-\nine this descriptor in detail. It conforms to the v1 version of the Kubernetes API. The\ntype of resource you\u2019re describing is a pod, with the name kubia-manual. The pod\nconsists of a single container based on the luksa/kubia image. You\u2019ve also given a\nname to the container and indicated that it\u2019s listening on port 8080. \nSPECIFYING CONTAINER PORTS\nSpecifying ports in the pod definition is purely informational.

The status\npart contains read-only runtime data that shows the state of the resource at a given\nmoment. When creating a new pod, you never need to provide the status part. \n The three parts described previously show the typical structure of a Kubernetes\nAPI object. As you\u2019ll see throughout the book, all other objects have the same anat-\nomy. This makes understanding new objects relatively easy.\n Going through all the individual properties in the previous YAML doesn\u2019t make\nmuch sense, so, instead, let\u2019s see what the most basic YAML for creating a pod looks\nlike. \n3.2.2\nCreating a simple YAML descriptor for a pod\nYou\u2019re going to create a file called kubia-manual.yaml (you can create it in any\ndirectory you want), or download the book\u2019s code archive, where you\u2019ll find the\nfile inside the Chapter03 directory. The following listing shows the entire contents\nof the file.\napiVersion: v1         \nkind: Pod                             \nmetadata:     \n  name: kubia-manual         \nspec: \n  containers: \n  - image: luksa/kubia          \n    name: kubia         \n    ports: \n    - containerPort: 8080     \n      protocol: TCP\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree this is much simpler than the definition in listing 3.1. Let\u2019s exam-\nine this descriptor in detail. It conforms to the v1 version of the Kubernetes API. The\ntype of resource you\u2019re describing is a pod, with the name kubia-manual. The pod\nconsists of a single container based on the luksa/kubia image. You\u2019ve also given a\nname to the container and indicated that it\u2019s listening on port 8080. \nSPECIFYING CONTAINER PORTS\nSpecifying ports in the pod definition is purely informational. Omitting them has no\neffect on whether clients can connect to the pod through the port or not.

This can be done through node labels and\nnode label selectors. \nUI pod\napp: ui\nrel: stable\nrel=stable\napp=ui\nAccount\nService\npod\napp: as\nrel: stable\napp=as\napp: pc\nrel: stable\napp=pc\napp: sc\nrel: stable\napp=sc\napp: os\nrel: stable\napp=os\nProduct\nCatalog\npod\nShopping\nCart\npod\nOrder\nService\npod\nUI pod\napp: ui\nrel: beta\nrel=beta\napp: pc\nrel: beta\napp: os\nrel: beta\nProduct\nCatalog\npod\nOrder\nService\npod\nrel=canary\nAccount\nService\npod\napp: as\nrel: canary\napp: pc\nrel: canary\napp: os\nrel: canary\nProduct\nCatalog\npod\nOrder\nService\npod\nFigure 3.9\nSelecting pods with multiple label selectors\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag103", "label": 1, "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "1"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_104", "label": "74\nCHAPTER 3\nPods: running containers in Kubernetes\n3.5.1\nUsing labels for categorizing worker nodes\nAs you learned earlier, pods aren\u2019t the only Kubernetes resource type that you can\nattach a label to.

You\u2019ll learn about this in chapters 12 through 14.\n3.7.3\nCreating a namespace\nA namespace is a Kubernetes resource like any other, so you can create it by posting a\nYAML file to the Kubernetes API server. Let\u2019s see how to do this now. \nCREATING A NAMESPACE FROM A YAML FILE\nFirst, create a custom-namespace.yaml file with the following listing\u2019s contents (you\u2019ll\nfind the file in the book\u2019s code archive).\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace         \nmetadata:\n  name: custom-namespace  \nNow, use kubectl to post the file to the Kubernetes API server:\n$ kubectl create -f custom-namespace.yaml\nnamespace \"custom-namespace\" created\nCREATING A NAMESPACE WITH KUBECTL CREATE NAMESPACE\nAlthough writing a file like the previous one isn\u2019t a big deal, it\u2019s still a hassle. Luckily,\nyou can also create namespaces with the dedicated kubectl create namespace com-\nmand, which is quicker than writing a YAML file. By having you create a YAML mani-\nfest for the namespace, I wanted to reinforce the idea that everything in Kubernetes\nListing 3.6\nA YAML definition of a namespace: custom-namespace.yaml\nThis says you\u2019re \ndefining a namespace.\nThis is the name \nof the namespace.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag108", "label": "table_flag108", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_109", "label": "79\nUsing namespaces to group resources\nhas a corresponding API object that you can create, read, update, and delete by post-\ning a YAML manifest to the API server.\n You could have created the namespace like this:\n$ kubectl create namespace custom-namespace\nnamespace \"custom-namespace\" created\nNOTE\nAlthough most objects\u2019 names must conform to the naming conven-\ntions specified in RFC 1035 (Domain names), which means they may contain\nonly letters, digits, dashes, and dots, namespaces (and a few others) aren\u2019t\nallowed to contain dots. \n3.7.4\nManaging objects in other namespaces\nTo create resources in the namespace you\u2019ve created, either add a namespace: custom-\nnamespace entry to the metadata section, or specify the namespace when creating the\nresource with the kubectl create command:\n$ kubectl create -f kubia-manual.yaml -n custom-namespace\npod \"kubia-manual\" created\nYou now have two pods with the same name (kubia-manual). One is in the default\nnamespace, and the other is in your custom-namespace.\n When listing, describing, modifying, or deleting objects in other namespaces, you\nneed to pass the --namespace (or -n) flag to kubectl. If you don\u2019t specify the name-\nspace, kubectl performs the action in the default namespace configured in the cur-\nrent kubectl context. The current context\u2019s namespace and the current context itself\ncan be changed through kubectl config commands. To learn more about managing\nkubectl contexts, refer to appendix A. \nTIP\nTo quickly switch to a different namespace, you can set up the following\nalias: alias kcd=\u0027kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-\ncontext) --namespace \u0027. You can then switch between namespaces using kcd\nsome-namespace.\n3.7.5\nUnderstanding the isolation provided by namespaces\nTo wrap up this section about namespaces, let me explain what namespaces don\u2019t pro-\nvide\u2014at least not out of the box. Although namespaces allow you to isolate objects\ninto distinct groups, which allows you to operate only on those belonging to the speci-\nfied namespace, they don\u2019t provide any kind of isolation of running objects. \n For example, you may think that when different users deploy pods across different\nnamespaces, those pods are isolated from each other and can\u2019t communicate, but that\u2019s\nnot necessarily the case. Whether namespaces provide network isolation depends on\nwhich networking solution is deployed with Kubernetes.

You\u2019ll also learn how to run managed pods\u2014both those that run\nindefinitely and those that perform a single task and then stop. \n4.1\nKeeping pods healthy\nOne of the main benefits of using Kubernetes is the ability to give it a list of contain-\ners and let it keep those containers running somewhere in the cluster. You do this by\ncreating a Pod resource and letting Kubernetes pick a worker node for it and run\nthe pod\u2019s containers on that node. But what if one of those containers dies? What if\nall containers of a pod die? \n As soon as a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node will run its con-\ntainers and, from then on, keep them running as long as the pod exists. If the con-\ntainer\u2019s main process crashes, the Kubelet will restart the container. If your\napplication has a bug that causes it to crash every once in a while, Kubernetes will\nrestart it automatically, so even without doing anything special in the app itself, run-\nning the app in Kubernetes automatically gives it the ability to heal itself. \n But sometimes apps stop working without their process crashing. For example, a\nJava app with a memory leak will start throwing OutOfMemoryErrors, but the JVM\nprocess will keep running. It would be great to have a way for an app to signal to\nKubernetes that it\u2019s no longer functioning properly and have Kubernetes restart it. \n We\u2019ve said that a container that crashes is restarted automatically, so maybe you\u2019re\nthinking you could catch these types of errors in the app and exit the process when\nthey occur. You can certainly do that, but it still doesn\u2019t solve all your problems. \n For example, what about those situations when your app stops responding because\nit falls into an infinite loop or a deadlock? To make sure applications are restarted in\nsuch cases, you must check an application\u2019s health from the outside and not depend\non the app doing it internally. \n4.1.1\nIntroducing liveness probes\nKubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes. You can specify\na liveness probe for each container in the pod\u2019s specification. Kubernetes will periodi-\ncally execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails. \nNOTE\nKubernetes also supports readiness probes, which we\u2019ll learn about in the\nnext chapter. Be sure not to confuse the two. They\u2019re used for two different\nthings.\nKubernetes can probe a container using one of the three mechanisms:\n\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe performs an HTTP GET request on the container\u2019s IP\naddress, a port and path you specify.

You do this by\ncreating a Pod resource and letting Kubernetes pick a worker node for it and run\nthe pod\u2019s containers on that node. But what if one of those containers dies? What if\nall containers of a pod die? \n As soon as a pod is scheduled to a node, the Kubelet on that node will run its con-\ntainers and, from then on, keep them running as long as the pod exists. If the con-\ntainer\u2019s main process crashes, the Kubelet will restart the container. If your\napplication has a bug that causes it to crash every once in a while, Kubernetes will\nrestart it automatically, so even without doing anything special in the app itself, run-\nning the app in Kubernetes automatically gives it the ability to heal itself. \n But sometimes apps stop working without their process crashing. For example, a\nJava app with a memory leak will start throwing OutOfMemoryErrors, but the JVM\nprocess will keep running. It would be great to have a way for an app to signal to\nKubernetes that it\u2019s no longer functioning properly and have Kubernetes restart it. \n We\u2019ve said that a container that crashes is restarted automatically, so maybe you\u2019re\nthinking you could catch these types of errors in the app and exit the process when\nthey occur. You can certainly do that, but it still doesn\u2019t solve all your problems. \n For example, what about those situations when your app stops responding because\nit falls into an infinite loop or a deadlock? To make sure applications are restarted in\nsuch cases, you must check an application\u2019s health from the outside and not depend\non the app doing it internally. \n4.1.1\nIntroducing liveness probes\nKubernetes can check if a container is still alive through liveness probes. You can specify\na liveness probe for each container in the pod\u2019s specification. Kubernetes will periodi-\ncally execute the probe and restart the container if the probe fails. \nNOTE\nKubernetes also supports readiness probes, which we\u2019ll learn about in the\nnext chapter. Be sure not to confuse the two. They\u2019re used for two different\nthings.\nKubernetes can probe a container using one of the three mechanisms:\n\uf0a1An HTTP GET probe performs an HTTP GET request on the container\u2019s IP\naddress, a port and path you specify. If the probe receives a response, and the\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag115", "label": "table_flag115", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_116", "label": "86\nCHAPTER 4\nReplication and other controllers: deploying managed pods\nresponse code doesn\u2019t represent an error (in other words, if the HTTP response\ncode is 2xx or 3xx), the probe is considered successful. If the server returns an\nerror response code or if it doesn\u2019t respond at all, the probe is considered a fail-\nure and the container will be restarted as a result.\n\uf0a1A TCP Socket probe tries to open a TCP connection to the specified port of the\ncontainer. If the connection is established successfully, the probe is successful.\nOtherwise, the container is restarted.\n\uf0a1An Exec probe executes an arbitrary command inside the container and checks\nthe command\u2019s exit status code. If the status code is 0, the probe is successful.\nAll other codes are considered failures. \n4.1.2\nCreating an HTTP-based liveness probe\nLet\u2019s see how to add a liveness probe to your Node.js app. Because it\u2019s a web app, it\nmakes sense to add a liveness probe that will check whether its web server is serving\nrequests. But because this particular Node.js app is too simple to ever fail, you\u2019ll need\nto make the app fail artificially. \n To properly demo liveness probes, you\u2019ll modify the app slightly and make it\nreturn a 500 Internal Server Error HTTP status code for each request after the fifth\none\u2014your app will handle the first five client requests properly and then return an\nerror on every subsequent request. Thanks to the liveness probe, it should be restarted\nwhen that happens, allowing it to properly handle client requests again.\n You can find the code of the new app in the book\u2019s code archive (in the folder\nChapter04/kubia-unhealthy). I\u2019ve pushed the container image to Docker Hub, so you\ndon\u2019t need to build it yourself. \n You\u2019ll create a new pod that includes an HTTP GET liveness probe.

While this may\nseem overly simple, even a liveness probe like this does wonders, because it causes the\ncontainer to be restarted if the web server running within the container stops\nresponding to HTTP requests. Compared to having no liveness probe, this is a major\nimprovement, and may be sufficient in most cases.\n But for a better liveness check, you\u2019d configure the probe to perform requests on a\nspecific URL path (/health, for example) and have the app perform an internal sta-\ntus check of all the vital components running inside the app to ensure none of them\nhas died or is unresponsive. \nTIP\nMake sure the /health HTTP endpoint doesn\u2019t require authentication;\notherwise the probe will always fail, causing your container to be restarted\nindefinitely.\nBe sure to check only the internals of the app and nothing influenced by an external\nfactor.

By default, the probes are executed relatively often and are\nonly allowed one second to complete. Having a probe that does heavy lifting can slow\ndown your container considerably. Later in the book, you\u2019ll also learn about how to\nlimit CPU time available to a container.

By default, the probes are executed relatively often and are\nonly allowed one second to complete. Having a probe that does heavy lifting can slow\ndown your container considerably.

It\u2019s a nice little helper, isn\u2019t it?\nGETTING INFORMATION ABOUT A REPLICATIONCONTROLLER\nNow, let\u2019s see what information the kubectl get command shows for Replication-\nControllers:\n$ kubectl get rc\nNAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE\nkubia     3         3         2         3m\nNOTE\nWe\u2019re using rc as a shorthand for replicationcontroller.\nYou see three columns showing the desired number of pods, the actual number of\npods, and how many of them are ready (you\u2019ll learn what that means in the next chap-\nter, when we talk about readiness probes).\n You can see additional information about your ReplicationController with the\nkubectl describe command, as shown in the following listing.\n$ kubectl describe rc kubia\nName:           kubia\nNamespace:      default\nSelector:       app=kubia\nLabels:         app=kubia\nAnnotations:    \u003cnone\u003e\nReplicas:       3 current / 3 desired               \nPods Status:    4 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed  \nPod Template:\n  Labels:       app=kubia\n  Containers:   ...\nListing 4.5\nDisplaying details of a ReplicationController with kubectl describe\nThe actual vs. the \ndesired number of \npod instances\nNumber of \npod instances \nper pod \nstatus\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag125", "label": "table_flag125", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_126", "label": "96\nCHAPTER 4\nReplication and other controllers: deploying managed pods\n  Volumes:      \u003cnone\u003e\nEvents:                                                   \nFrom                    Type      Reason           Message\n----                    -------  ------            -------\nreplication-controller  Normal   SuccessfulCreate  Created pod: kubia-53thy\nreplication-controller  Normal   SuccessfulCreate  Created pod: kubia-k0xz6\nreplication-controller  Normal   SuccessfulCreate  Created pod: kubia-q3vkg\nreplication-controller  Normal   SuccessfulCreate  Created pod: kubia-oini2\nThe current number of replicas matches the desired number, because the controller\nhas already created a new pod.

The biggest benefit of doing so is\nthat it enables you to change port numbers later without having to change the service\nspec. Your pod currently uses port 8080 for http, but what if you later decide you\u2019d\nlike to move that to port 80? \n If you\u2019re using named ports, all you need to do is change the port number in the\npod spec (while keeping the port\u2019s name unchanged). As you spin up pods with the\nnew ports, client connections will be forwarded to the appropriate port numbers,\ndepending on the pod receiving the connection (port 8080 on old pods and port 80\non the new ones).\n5.1.2\nDiscovering services\nBy creating a service, you now have a single and stable IP address and port that you\ncan hit to access your pods. This address will remain unchanged throughout the\nwhole lifetime of the service. Pods behind this service may come and go, their IPs may\nchange, their number can go up or down, but they\u2019ll always be accessible through the\nservice\u2019s single and constant IP address. \n But how do the client pods know the IP and port of a service? Do you need to cre-\nate the service first, then manually look up its IP address and pass the IP to the config-\nuration options of the client pod? Not really. Kubernetes also provides ways for client\npods to discover a service\u2019s IP and port.\nDISCOVERING SERVICES THROUGH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES\nWhen a pod is started, Kubernetes initializes a set of environment variables pointing\nto each service that exists at that moment. If you create the service before creating the\nclient pods, processes in those pods can get the IP address and port of the service by\ninspecting their environment variables. \n Let\u2019s see what those environment variables look like by examining the environment\nof one of your running pods. You\u2019ve already learned that you can use the kubectl exec\ncommand to run a command in the pod, but because you created the service only\nafter your pods had been created, the environment variables for the service couldn\u2019t\nhave been set yet. You\u2019ll need to address that first.\n Before you can see environment variables for your service, you first need to delete\nall the pods and let the ReplicationController create new ones. You may remember\nyou can delete all pods without specifying their names like this:\n$ kubectl delete po --all\npod \"kubia-7nog1\" deleted\npod \"kubia-bf50t\" deleted\npod \"kubia-gzwli\" deleted\nNow you can list the new pods (I\u2019m sure you know how to do that) and pick one as\nyour target for the kubectl exec command.

You may have already noticed endpoints if you used the kubectl describe\ncommand on your service, as shown in the following listing.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag161", "label": "table_flag161", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_162", "label": "132\nCHAPTER 5\nServices: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods\n$ kubectl describe svc kubia\nName:                kubia\nNamespace:           default\nLabels:              \u003cnone\u003e\nSelector:            app=kubia         \nType:                ClusterIP\nIP:                  10.111.249.153\nPort:                \u003cunset\u003e 80/TCP\nEndpoints:           10.108.1.4:8080,10.108.2.5:8080,10.108.2.6:8080   \nSession Affinity:    None\nNo events.\nAn Endpoints resource (yes, plural) is a list of IP addresses and ports exposing a ser-\nvice.

Instead, the selector is used to build a list of IPs\nand ports, which is then stored in the Endpoints resource. When a client connects to a\nservice, the service proxy selects one of those IP and port pairs and redirects the\nincoming connection to the server listening at that location.\n5.2.2\nManually configuring service endpoints\nYou may have probably realized this already, but having the service\u2019s endpoints decou-\npled from the service allows them to be configured and updated manually. \n If you create a service without a pod selector, Kubernetes won\u2019t even create the\nEndpoints resource (after all, without a selector, it can\u2019t know which pods to include\nin the service).

For example, let\u2019s imagine there\u2019s a\npublic API available at api.somecompany.com. You can define a service that points to\nit as shown in the following listing.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: external-service\nspec:\n  type: ExternalName                       \n  externalName: someapi.somecompany.com     \n  ports:\n  - port: 80\nAfter the service is created, pods can connect to the external service through the\nexternal-service.default.svc.cluster.local domain name (or even external-\nservice) instead of using the service\u2019s actual FQDN. This hides the actual service\nname and its location from pods consuming the service, allowing you to modify the\nservice definition and point it to a different service any time later, by only changing\nthe externalName attribute or by changing the type back to ClusterIP and creating\nan Endpoints object for the service\u2014either manually or by specifying a label selector\non the service and having it created automatically.\n ExternalName services are implemented solely at the DNS level\u2014a simple CNAME\nDNS record is created for the service.

When a client sends an HTTP request to the\nIngress, the host and path in the request determine which service the request is for-\nwarded to, as shown in figure 5.9.\n \n50%\n50%\n50%\n25%\n25%\nNode A\nPod\nNode B\nPod\nPod\nLoad balancer\nFigure 5.8\nA Service using \nthe Local external traffic \npolicy may lead to uneven \nload distribution across pods.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag172", "label": 1, "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "1"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_173", "label": "143\nExposing services externally through an Ingress resource\nIngresses operate at the application layer of the network stack (HTTP) and can pro-\nvide features such as cookie-based session affinity and the like, which services can\u2019t.\nUNDERSTANDING THAT AN INGRESS CONTROLLER IS REQUIRED\nBefore we go into the features an Ingress object provides, let me emphasize that to\nmake Ingress resources work, an Ingress controller needs to be running in the cluster.\nDifferent Kubernetes environments use different implementations of the controller,\nbut several don\u2019t provide a default controller at all. \n For example, Google Kubernetes Engine uses Google Cloud Platform\u2019s own HTTP\nload-balancing features to provide the Ingress functionality.

But what about HTTPS? Let\u2019s take\na quick look at how to configure Ingress to support TLS. \nCREATING A TLS CERTIFICATE FOR THE INGRESS\nWhen a client opens a TLS connection to an Ingress controller, the controller termi-\nnates the TLS connection. The communication between the client and the controller\nis encrypted, whereas the communication between the controller and the backend\npod isn\u2019t. The application running in the pod doesn\u2019t need to support TLS. For exam-\nple, if the pod runs a web server, it can accept only HTTP traffic and let the Ingress\ncontroller take care of everything related to TLS. To enable the controller to do that,\nyou need to attach a certificate and a private key to the Ingress. The two need to be\nstored in a Kubernetes resource called a Secret, which is then referenced in the\nIngress manifest. We\u2019ll explain Secrets in detail in chapter 7. For now, you\u2019ll create the\nSecret without paying too much attention to it.\n First, you need to create the private key and certificate:\n$ openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj \n\u27a5 /CN=kubia.example.com\nListing 5.15\nIngress exposing multiple services on different hosts\nRequests for \nfoo.example.com will be \nrouted to service foo.\nRequests for \nbar.example.com will be \nrouted to service bar.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "147\nExposing services externally through an Ingress resource\nMAPPING DIFFERENT SERVICES TO DIFFERENT HOSTS\nSimilarly, you can use an Ingress to map to different services based on the host in the\nHTTP request instead of (only) the path, as shown in the next listing.\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: foo.example.com          \n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: / \n        backend:\n          serviceName: foo         \n          servicePort: 80\n  - host: bar.example.com          \n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        backend:\n          serviceName: bar         \n          servicePort: 80\nRequests received by the controller will be forwarded to either service foo or bar,\ndepending on the Host header in the request (the way virtual hosts are handled in\nweb servers).

For now, you\u2019ll create the\nSecret without paying too much attention to it.\n First, you need to create the private key and certificate:\n$ openssl genrsa -out tls.key 2048\n$ openssl req -new -x509 -key tls.key -out tls.cert -days 360 -subj \n\u27a5 /CN=kubia.example.com\nListing 5.15\nIngress exposing multiple services on different hosts\nRequests for \nfoo.example.com will be \nrouted to service foo.\nRequests for \nbar.example.com will be \nrouted to service bar.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag177", "label": "table_flag177", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_178", "label": "148\nCHAPTER 5\nServices: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods\nThen you create the Secret from the two files like this:\n$ kubectl create secret tls tls-secret --cert=tls.cert --key=tls.key\nsecret \"tls-secret\" created\nThe private key and the certificate are now stored in the Secret called tls-secret.\nNow, you can update your Ingress object so it will also accept HTTPS requests for\nkubia.example.com.

After that, it\ninvokes the probe periodically and acts based on the result of the readiness probe. If a\npod reports that it\u2019s not ready, it\u2019s removed from the service.

This is an important distinction between liveness and readiness probes.\nLiveness probes keep pods healthy by killing off unhealthy containers and replacing\nthem with new, healthy ones, whereas readiness probes make sure that only pods that\nare ready to serve requests receive them. This is mostly necessary during container\nstart up, but it\u2019s also useful after the container has been running for a while. \n As you can see in figure 5.11, if a pod\u2019s readiness probe fails, the pod is removed\nfrom the Endpoints object.

You\u2019ve learned how Kubernetes\n\uf0a1Exposes multiple pods that match a certain label selector under a single, stable\nIP address and port\n\uf0a1Makes services accessible from inside the cluster by default, but allows you to\nmake the service accessible from outside the cluster by setting its type to either\nNodePort or LoadBalancer\n\uf0a1Enables pods to discover services together with their IP addresses and ports by\nlooking up environment variables\n\uf0a1Allows discovery of and communication with services residing outside the\ncluster by creating a Service resource without specifying a selector, by creating\nan associated Endpoints resource instead\n\uf0a1Provides a DNS CNAME alias for external services with the ExternalName ser-\nvice type\n\uf0a1Exposes multiple HTTP services through a single Ingress (consuming a sin-\ngle IP)\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag187", "label": "table_flag187", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_188", "label": "158\nCHAPTER 5\nServices: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods\n\uf0a1Uses a pod container\u2019s readiness probe to determine whether a pod should or\nshouldn\u2019t be included as a service endpoint\n\uf0a1Enables discovery of pod IPs through DNS when you create a headless service\nAlong with getting a better understanding of services, you\u2019ve also learned how to\n\uf0a1Troubleshoot them\n\uf0a1Modify firewall rules in Google Kubernetes/Compute Engine\n\uf0a1Execute commands in pod containers through kubectl exec \n\uf0a1Run a bash shell in an existing pod\u2019s container\n\uf0a1Modify Kubernetes resources through the kubectl apply command\n\uf0a1Run an unmanaged ad hoc pod with kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "158\nCHAPTER 5\nServices: enabling clients to discover and talk to pods\n\uf0a1Uses a pod container\u2019s readiness probe to determine whether a pod should or\nshouldn\u2019t be included as a service endpoint\n\uf0a1Enables discovery of pod IPs through DNS when you create a headless service\nAlong with getting a better understanding of services, you\u2019ve also learned how to\n\uf0a1Troubleshoot them\n\uf0a1Modify firewall rules in Google Kubernetes/Compute Engine\n\uf0a1Execute commands in pod containers through kubectl exec \n\uf0a1Run a bash shell in an existing pod\u2019s container\n\uf0a1Modify Kubernetes resources through the kubectl apply command\n\uf0a1Run an unmanaged ad hoc pod with kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag188", "label": "table_flag188", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_189", "label": "159\nVolumes: attaching\ndisk storage to containers\nIn the previous three chapters, we introduced pods and other Kubernetes resources\nthat interact with them, namely ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, DaemonSets,\nJobs, and Services.

One container\nruns a web server that serves HTML pages from the /var/htdocs directory and stores\nthe access log to /var/logs.

Creating a pod with these three containers without\nthem sharing disk storage doesn\u2019t make any sense, because the content generator\nwould write the generated HTML files inside its own container and the web server\ncouldn\u2019t access those files, as it runs in a separate isolated container. Instead, it would\nserve an empty directory or whatever you put in the /var/htdocs directory in its con-\ntainer image. Similarly, the log rotator would never have anything to do, because its\n/var/logs directory would always remain empty with nothing writing logs there.

Linux allows you to mount a filesystem at arbitrary locations\nin the file tree. When you do that, the contents of the mounted filesystem are accessi-\nble in the directory it\u2019s mounted into. By mounting the same volume into two contain-\ners, they can operate on the same files. In your case, you\u2019re mounting two volumes in\nthree containers. By doing this, your three containers can work together and do some-\nthing useful. Let me explain how.\n First, the pod has a volume called publicHtml. This volume is mounted in the Web-\nServer container at /var/htdocs, because that\u2019s the directory the web server serves\nfiles from. The same volume is also mounted in the ContentAgent container, but at\n/var/html, because that\u2019s where the agent writes the files to.

This volume is\nmounted at /var/logs in both the WebServer and the LogRotator containers. Note\nthat it isn\u2019t mounted in the ContentAgent container. The container cannot access its\nfiles, even though the container and the volume are part of the same pod. It\u2019s not\nenough to define a volume in the pod; you need to define a VolumeMount inside the\ncontainer\u2019s spec also, if you want the container to be able to access it.\n The two volumes in this example can both initially be empty, so you can use a type\nof volume called emptyDir. Kubernetes also supports other types of volumes that are\neither populated during initialization of the volume from an external source, or an\nexisting directory is mounted inside the volume. This process of populating or mount-\ning a volume is performed before the pod\u2019s containers are started. \n A volume is bound to the lifecycle of a pod and will stay in existence only while the\npod exists, but depending on the volume type, the volume\u2019s files may remain intact\neven after the pod and volume disappear, and can later be mounted into a new vol-\nume.

If you set\neverything up correctly, you should see that the files the web server is serving are kept\nin sync with your GitHub repo. \nNOTE\nAn example in chapter 18 includes using a Git sync container like the\none explained here, so you can wait until you reach chapter 18 and follow the\nstep-by-step instructions then instead of doing this exercise on your own now. \nUSING A GITREPO VOLUME WITH PRIVATE GIT REPOSITORIES\nThere\u2019s one other reason for having to resort to Git sync sidecar containers.

When\nthe pod is deleted, the volume and its contents are deleted. Other types of volumes,\nhowever, don\u2019t create a new directory, but instead mount an existing external direc-\ntory into the pod\u2019s container\u2019s filesystem. The contents of that volume can survive\nmultiple pod instantiations. We\u2019ll learn about those types of volumes next.\n6.3\nAccessing files on the worker node\u2019s filesystem\nMost  pods should be oblivious of their host node, so they shouldn\u2019t access any files on\nthe node\u2019s filesystem.

When\nthe pod is deleted, the volume and its contents are deleted. Other types of volumes,\nhowever, don\u2019t create a new directory, but instead mount an existing external direc-\ntory into the pod\u2019s container\u2019s filesystem. The contents of that volume can survive\nmultiple pod instantiations. We\u2019ll learn about those types of volumes next.\n6.3\nAccessing files on the worker node\u2019s filesystem\nMost  pods should be oblivious of their host node, so they shouldn\u2019t access any files on\nthe node\u2019s filesystem.

If\nyour cluster runs on Microsoft Azure, you can use the azureFile or the azureDisk\nvolume. We won\u2019t go into detail on how to do that here, but it\u2019s virtually the same as in\nthe previous example. First, you need to create the actual underlying storage, and\nthen set the appropriate properties in the volume definition.\nUSING AN AWS ELASTIC BLOCK STORE VOLUME\nFor example, to use an AWS elastic block store instead of the GCE Persistent Disk,\nyou\u2019d only need to change the volume definition as shown in the following listing (see\nthose lines printed in bold).\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: mongodb \nspec:\n  volumes:                       \n  - name: mongodb-data           \n    awsElasticBlockStore:          \nListing 6.6\nRetrieving MongoDB\u2019s persisted data in a new pod\nListing 6.7\nA pod using an awsElasticBlockStore volume: mongodb-pod-aws.yaml\nUsing awsElasticBlockStore \ninstead of gcePersistentDisk\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "174\nCHAPTER 6\nVolumes: attaching disk storage to containers\nOnce the container is up, you can again run the MongoDB shell and check to see if the\ndocument you stored earlier can still be retrieved, as shown in the following listing.\n$ kubectl exec -it mongodb mongo\nMongoDB shell version: 3.2.8\nconnecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017\nWelcome to the MongoDB shell.\n...\n\u003e use mystore\nswitched to db mystore\n\u003e db.foo.find()\n{ \"_id\" : ObjectId(\"57a61eb9de0cfd512374cc75\"), \"name\" : \"foo\" }\nAs expected, the data is still there, even though you deleted the pod and re-created it.\nThis confirms you can use a GCE persistent disk to persist data across multiple pod\ninstances. \n You\u2019re done playing with the MongoDB pod, so go ahead and delete it again, but\nhold off on deleting the underlying GCE persistent disk.

The Nginx image\nalready contains this file with default configuration options, which you don\u2019t want\nto override, so you don\u2019t want to replace this file as a whole. Luckily, the default\nconfig file automatically includes all .conf files in the /etc/nginx/conf.d/ subdirec-\ntory as well, so you should add your config file in there. Figure 7.9 shows what you\nwant to achieve.\n The pod descriptor is shown in listing 7.14 (the irrelevant parts are omitted, but\nyou\u2019ll find the complete file in the code archive).\n \n \nListing 7.13\nYAML definition of a config map created from a file\nThe entry holding the \nNginx config file\u2019s \ncontents\nThe sleep-interval entry\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag237", "label": "table_flag237", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_238", "label": "208\nCHAPTER 7\nConfigMaps and Secrets: configuring applications\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fortune-configmap-volume\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - image: nginx:alpine\n    name: web-server\n    volumeMounts:\n    ...\n    - name: config\n      mountPath: /etc/nginx/conf.d      \n      readOnly: true\n    ...\n  volumes:\n  ...\n  - name: config              \n    configMap:                 \n      name: fortune-config     \n  ...\nThis pod definition includes a volume, which references your fortune-config\nConfigMap.

If\nyou list all the files in the mounted configMap volume, you\u2019ll see something like the\nfollowing listing.\n$ kubectl exec -it fortune-configmap-volume -c web-server -- ls -lA \n\u27a5  /etc/nginx/conf.d\ntotal 4\ndrwxr-xr-x  ... 12:15 ..4984_09_04_12_15_06.865837643\nListing 7.19\nFiles in a mounted configMap volume\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag242", "label": "table_flag242", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_243", "label": "213\nUsing Secrets to pass sensitive data to containers\nlrwxrwxrwx  ... 12:15 ..data -\u003e ..4984_09_04_12_15_06.865837643\nlrwxrwxrwx  ... 12:15 my-nginx-config.conf -\u003e ..data/my-nginx-config.conf\nlrwxrwxrwx  ... 12:15 sleep-interval -\u003e ..data/sleep-interval\nAs you can see, the files in the mounted configMap volume are symbolic links point-\ning to files in the ..data dir.

The sym-\nlink can either be created in the container image itself, or you could create the\nsymlink when the container starts.\nUNDERSTANDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF UPDATING A CONFIGMAP\nOne of the most important features of containers is their immutability, which allows\nus to be certain that no differences exist between multiple running containers created\nfrom the same image, so is it wrong to bypass this immutability by modifying a Config-\nMap used by running containers? \n The main problem occurs when the app doesn\u2019t support reloading its configura-\ntion. This results in different running instances being configured differently\u2014those\npods that are created after the ConfigMap is changed will use the new config, whereas\nthe old pods will still use the old one. And this isn\u2019t limited to new pods. If a pod\u2019s con-\ntainer is restarted (for whatever reason), the new process will also see the new config.\nTherefore, if the app doesn\u2019t reload its config automatically, modifying an existing\nConfigMap (while pods are using it) may not be a good idea. \n If the app does support reloading, modifying the ConfigMap usually isn\u2019t such a\nbig deal, but you do need to be aware that because files in the ConfigMap volumes\naren\u2019t updated synchronously across all running instances, the files in individual pods\nmay be out of sync for up to a whole minute.\n7.5\nUsing Secrets to pass sensitive data to containers\nAll the information you\u2019ve passed to your containers so far is regular, non-sensitive\nconfiguration data that doesn\u2019t need to be kept secure.

The Down-\nward API allows you to expose the data to the application without having to rewrite\nthe application or wrap it in a shell script, which collects the data and then exposes it\nthrough environment variables.\n But the metadata available through the Downward API is fairly limited.

You\u2019ll learn\nhow to do that next.\n8.2\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\nWe\u2019ve seen how the Downward API provides a simple way to pass certain pod and con-\ntainer metadata to the process running inside them. It only exposes the pod\u2019s own\nmetadata and a subset of all of the pod\u2019s data. But sometimes your app will need to\nknow more about other pods and even other resources defined in your cluster.

You\u2019ll learn\nhow to do that next.\n8.2\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\nWe\u2019ve seen how the Downward API provides a simple way to pass certain pod and con-\ntainer metadata to the process running inside them. It only exposes the pod\u2019s own\nmetadata and a subset of all of the pod\u2019s data. But sometimes your app will need to\nknow more about other pods and even other resources defined in your cluster. The\nDownward API doesn\u2019t help in those cases.\nListing 8.6\nReferring to container-level metadata in a downwardAPI volume\nContainer name \nmust be specified\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag263", "label": "table_flag263", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_264", "label": "234\nCHAPTER 8\nAccessing pod metadata and other resources from applications\n As you\u2019ve seen throughout the book, information about services and pods can be\nobtained by looking at the service-related environment variables or through DNS. But\nwhen the app needs data about other resources or when it requires access to the most\nup-to-date information as possible, it needs to talk to the API server directly (as shown\nin figure 8.4).\nBefore you see how apps within pods can talk to the Kubernetes API server, let\u2019s first\nexplore the server\u2019s REST endpoints from your local machine, so you can see what\ntalking to the API server looks like.\n8.2.1\nExploring the Kubernetes REST API\nYou\u2019ve learned about different Kubernetes resource types.

Therefore, to talk to the API server from inside a pod, you need\nto take care of three things:\n\uf0a1Find the location of the API server.\n\uf0a1Make sure you\u2019re talking to the API server and not something impersonating it.\n\uf0a1Authenticate with the server; otherwise it won\u2019t let you see or do anything.\nListing 8.11\nRetrieving a resource in a specific namespace by name\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag268", "label": "table_flag268", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_269", "label": "239\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\nYou\u2019ll see how this is done in the next three sections. \nRUNNING A POD TO TRY OUT COMMUNICATION WITH THE API SERVER\nThe first thing you need is a pod from which to talk to the API server. You\u2019ll run a pod\nthat does nothing (it runs the sleep command in its only container), and then run a\nshell in the container with kubectl exec. Then you\u2019ll try to access the API server from\nwithin that shell using curl.\n Therefore, you need to use a container image that contains the curl binary. If you\nsearch for such an image on, say, Docker Hub, you\u2019ll find the tutum/curl image, so\nuse it (you can also use any other existing image containing the curl binary or you\ncan build your own). The pod definition is shown in the following listing.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: curl\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: main\n    image: tutum/curl                \n    command: [\"sleep\", \"9999999\"]    \nAfter creating the pod, run kubectl exec to run a bash shell inside its container:\n$ kubectl exec -it curl bash\nroot@curl:/#\nYou\u2019re now ready to talk to the API server.\nFINDING THE API SERVER\u2019S ADDRESS\nFirst, you need to find the IP and port of the Kubernetes API server. This is easy,\nbecause a Service called kubernetes is automatically exposed in the default name-\nspace and configured to point to the API server. You may remember seeing it every\ntime you listed services with kubectl get svc:\n$ kubectl get svc\nNAME         CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE\nkubernetes   10.0.0.1     \u003cnone\u003e        443/TCP   46d\nAnd you\u2019ll remember from chapter 5 that environment variables are configured for\neach service. You can get both the IP address and the port of the API server by looking\nup the KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST and KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT variables (inside\nthe container):\nroot@curl:/# env | grep KUBERNETES_SERVICE\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT=443\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST=10.0.0.1\nKUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443\nListing 8.12\nA pod for trying out communication with the API server: curl.yaml\nUsing the tutum/curl image, \nbecause you need curl \navailable in the container\nYou\u2019re running the sleep \ncommand with a long delay to \nkeep your container running.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "239\nTalking to the Kubernetes API server\nYou\u2019ll see how this is done in the next three sections. \nRUNNING A POD TO TRY OUT COMMUNICATION WITH THE API SERVER\nThe first thing you need is a pod from which to talk to the API server.

Imagine having a set of pod instances providing a\nservice to other pods and/or external clients. After reading this book up to this point,\nyou likely recognize that these pods are backed by a ReplicationController or a\nReplicaSet.

You then develop a newer version of the app and push it to an image\nrepository as a new image, tagged as v2. You\u2019d next like to replace all the pods with\nthis new version. Because you can\u2019t change an existing pod\u2019s image after the pod is\ncreated, you need to remove the old pods and replace them with new ones running\nthe new image. \n You have two ways of updating all those pods. You can do one of the following:\n\uf0a1Delete all existing pods first and then start the new ones.\n\uf0a1Start new ones and, once they\u2019re up, delete the old ones. You can do this either\nby adding all the new pods and then deleting all the old ones at once, or\nsequentially, by adding new pods and removing old ones gradually.\nBoth these strategies have their benefits and drawbacks. The first option would lead to\na short period of time when your application is unavailable. The second option\nrequires your app to handle running two versions of the app at the same time.

It\u2019s possible to have the Service front only the\ninitial version of the pods while you bring up the pods running the new version. Then,\nonce all the new pods are up, you can change the Service\u2019s label selector and have the\nService switch over to the new pods, as shown in figure 9.3. This is called a blue-green\ndeployment. After switching over, and once you\u2019re sure the new version functions cor-\nrectly, you\u2019re free to delete the old pods by deleting the old ReplicationController.\nNOTE\nYou can change a Service\u2019s pod selector with the kubectl set selec-\ntor command.\nPERFORMING A ROLLING UPDATE\nInstead of bringing up all the new pods and deleting the old pods at once, you can\nalso perform a rolling update, which replaces pods step by step. You do this by slowly\nscaling down the previous ReplicationController and scaling up the new one. In this\ncase, you\u2019ll want the Service\u2019s pod selector to include both the old and the new pods,\nso it directs requests toward both sets of pods. See figure 9.4.\n Doing a rolling update manually is laborious and error-prone. Depending on the\nnumber of replicas, you\u2019d need to run a dozen or more commands in the proper\norder to perform the update process.

What\u2019s so wrong with this process that a bet-\nter one had to be introduced? \n Well, for starters, I, for one, don\u2019t like Kubernetes modifying objects I\u2019ve created.\nOkay, it\u2019s perfectly fine for the scheduler to assign a node to my pods after I create\nthem, but Kubernetes modifying the labels of my pods and the label selectors of my\nReplicationControllers is something that I don\u2019t expect and could cause me to go\naround the office yelling at my colleagues, \u201cWho\u2019s been messing with my controllers!?!?\u201d \n But even more importantly, if you\u2019ve paid close attention to the words I\u2019ve used,\nyou probably noticed that all this time I said explicitly that the kubectl client was the\none performing all these steps of the rolling update. \n You can see this by turning on verbose logging with the --v option when triggering\nthe rolling update:\n$ kubectl rolling-update kubia-v1 kubia-v2 --image=luksa/kubia:v2 --v 6\nTIP\nUsing the --v 6 option increases the logging level enough to let you see\nthe requests kubectl is sending to the API server.\nUsing this option, kubectl will print out each HTTP request it sends to the Kuberne-\ntes API server. You\u2019ll see PUT requests to\n/api/v1/namespaces/default/replicationcontrollers/kubia-v1\nwhich is the RESTful URL representing your kubia-v1 ReplicationController resource.\nThese requests are the ones scaling down your ReplicationController, which shows\nListing 9.6\nThe final steps performed by kubectl rolling-update\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag290", "label": "table_flag290", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_291", "label": "261\nUsing Deployments for updating apps declaratively\nthat the kubectl client is the one doing the scaling, instead of it being performed by\nthe Kubernetes master. \nTIP\nUse the verbose logging option when running other kubectl commands,\nto learn more about the communication between kubectl and the API server. \nBut why is it such a bad thing that the update process is being performed by the client\ninstead of on the server? Well, in your case, the update went smoothly, but what if you\nlost network connectivity while kubectl was performing the update? The update pro-\ncess would be interrupted mid-way. Pods and ReplicationControllers would end up in\nan intermediate state.\n Another reason why performing an update like this isn\u2019t as good as it could be is\nbecause it\u2019s imperative. Throughout this book, I\u2019ve stressed how Kubernetes is about\nyou telling it the desired state of the system and having Kubernetes achieve that\nstate on its own, by figuring out the best way to do it. This is how pods are deployed\nand how pods are scaled up and down. You never tell Kubernetes to add an addi-\ntional pod or remove an excess one\u2014you change the number of desired replicas\nand that\u2019s it.\n Similarly, you will also want to change the desired image tag in your pod defini-\ntions and have Kubernetes replace the pods with new ones running the new image.\nThis is exactly what drove the introduction of a new resource called a Deployment,\nwhich is now the preferred way of deploying applications in Kubernetes. \n9.3\nUsing Deployments for updating apps declaratively\nA Deployment is a higher-level resource meant for deploying applications and\nupdating them declaratively, instead of doing it through a ReplicationController or\na ReplicaSet, which are both considered lower-level concepts.\n When you create a Deployment, a ReplicaSet resource is created underneath\n(eventually more of them). As you may remember from chapter 4, ReplicaSets are a\nnew generation of ReplicationControllers, and should be used instead of them. Replica-\nSets replicate and manage pods, as well. When using a Deployment, the actual pods\nare created and managed by the Deployment\u2019s ReplicaSets, not by the Deployment\ndirectly (the relationship is shown in figure 9.8).\nYou might wonder why you\u2019d want to complicate things by introducing another object\non top of a ReplicationController or ReplicaSet, when they\u2019re what suffices to keep a set\nof pod instances running. As the rolling update example in section 9.2 demonstrates,\nwhen updating the app, you need to introduce an additional ReplicationController and\nPods\nReplicaSet\nDeployment\nFigure 9.8\nA Deployment is backed \nby a ReplicaSet, which supervises the \ndeployment\u2019s pods.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "261\nUsing Deployments for updating apps declaratively\nthat the kubectl client is the one doing the scaling, instead of it being performed by\nthe Kubernetes master. \nTIP\nUse the verbose logging option when running other kubectl commands,\nto learn more about the communication between kubectl and the API server. \nBut why is it such a bad thing that the update process is being performed by the client\ninstead of on the server?

This doesn\u2019t\ncause any kind of update to the pods, because you didn\u2019t change the pod template.\nChanging other Deployment properties, like the desired replica count or the deploy-\nment strategy, also doesn\u2019t trigger a rollout, because it doesn\u2019t affect the existing indi-\nvidual pods in any way.\nTRIGGERING THE ROLLING UPDATE\nIf you\u2019d like to track the update process as it progresses, first run the curl loop again\nin another terminal to see what\u2019s happening with the requests (don\u2019t forget to replace\nthe IP with the actual external IP of your service):\n$ while true; do curl http://130.211.109.222; done\nTo trigger the actual rollout, you\u2019ll change the image used in the single pod container\nto luksa/kubia:v2. Instead of editing the whole YAML of the Deployment object or\nusing the patch command to change the image, you\u2019ll use the kubectl set image\ncommand, which allows changing the image of any resource that contains a container\n(ReplicationControllers, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and so on). You\u2019ll use it to modify\nyour Deployment like this:\n$ kubectl set image deployment kubia nodejs=luksa/kubia:v2\ndeployment \"kubia\" image updated\nWhen you execute this command, you\u2019re updating the kubia Deployment\u2019s pod tem-\nplate so the image used in its nodejs container is changed to luksa/kubia:v2 (from\n:v1).

In chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolume-\nClaims, which allow persistent storage to be attached to a pod by referencing the\nPersistentVolumeClaim in the pod by name. Because PersistentVolumeClaims map\nto PersistentVolumes one-to-one, each pod of a StatefulSet needs to reference a dif-\nferent PersistentVolumeClaim to have its own separate PersistentVolume. Because\nall pod instances are stamped from the same pod template, how can they each refer\nto a different PersistentVolumeClaim? And who creates these claims? Surely you\u2019re\nnot expected to create as many PersistentVolumeClaims as the number of pods you\nplan to have in the StatefulSet upfront? Of course not.\nTEAMING UP POD TEMPLATES WITH VOLUME CLAIM TEMPLATES\nThe StatefulSet has to create the PersistentVolumeClaims as well, the same way it\u2019s cre-\nating the pods.

In chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolume-\nClaims, which allow persistent storage to be attached to a pod by referencing the\nPersistentVolumeClaim in the pod by name. Because PersistentVolumeClaims map\nto PersistentVolumes one-to-one, each pod of a StatefulSet needs to reference a dif-\nferent PersistentVolumeClaim to have its own separate PersistentVolume. Because\nall pod instances are stamped from the same pod template, how can they each refer\nto a different PersistentVolumeClaim? And who creates these claims? Surely you\u2019re\nnot expected to create as many PersistentVolumeClaims as the number of pods you\nplan to have in the StatefulSet upfront?

Then you\u2019ll\nsee if it\u2019s still serving the same data as before:\n$ kubectl delete po kubia-0\npod \"kubia-0\" deleted\nIf you list the pods, you\u2019ll see that the pod is terminating: \n$ kubectl get po\nNAME      READY     STATUS        RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-0   1/1       Terminating   0          3m\nkubia-1   1/1       Running       0          3m\nAs soon as it terminates successfully, a new pod with the same name is created by the\nStatefulSet:\n$ kubectl get po\nNAME      READY     STATUS              RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-0   0/1       ContainerCreating   0          6s\nkubia-1   1/1       Running             0          4m\n$ kubectl get po\nNAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\nkubia-0   1/1       Running   0          9s\nkubia-1   1/1       Running   0          4m\nLet me remind you again that this new pod may be scheduled to any node in the clus-\nter, not necessarily the same node that the old pod was scheduled to. The old pod\u2019s\nwhole identity (the name, hostname, and the storage) is effectively moved to the new\nnode (as shown in figure 10.11). If you\u2019re using Minikube, you can\u2019t see this because it\nonly runs a single node, but in a multi-node cluster, you may see the pod scheduled to\na different node than before.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag327", "label": "table_flag327", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_328", "label": "298\nCHAPTER 10\nStatefulSets: deploying replicated stateful applications\nWith the new pod now running, let\u2019s check to see if it has the exact same identity as in\nits previous incarnation.

This is left to the Scheduler. From afar, the operation of the Scheduler looks\nsimple. All it does is wait for newly created pods through the API server\u2019s watch mech-\nanism and assign a node to each new pod that doesn\u2019t already have the node set. \n The Scheduler doesn\u2019t instruct the selected node (or the Kubelet running on that\nnode) to run the pod. All the Scheduler does is update the pod definition through the\nAPI server. The API server then notifies the Kubelet (again, through the watch mech-\nanism described previously) that the pod has been scheduled. As soon as the Kubelet\non the target node sees the pod has been scheduled to its node, it creates and runs the\npod\u2019s containers.\n Although a coarse-grained view of the scheduling process seems trivial, the actual\ntask of selecting the best node for the pod isn\u2019t that simple. Sure, the simplest\nScheduler could pick a random node and not care about the pods already running on\nthat node.

This is left to the Scheduler. From afar, the operation of the Scheduler looks\nsimple. All it does is wait for newly created pods through the API server\u2019s watch mech-\nanism and assign a node to each new pod that doesn\u2019t already have the node set. \n The Scheduler doesn\u2019t instruct the selected node (or the Kubelet running on that\nnode) to run the pod. All the Scheduler does is update the pod definition through the\nAPI server. The API server then notifies the Kubelet (again, through the watch mech-\nanism described previously) that the pod has been scheduled. As soon as the Kubelet\non the target node sees the pod has been scheduled to its node, it creates and runs the\npod\u2019s containers.\n Although a coarse-grained view of the scheduling process seems trivial, the actual\ntask of selecting the best node for the pod isn\u2019t that simple. Sure, the simplest\nScheduler could pick a random node and not care about the pods already running on\nthat node. On the other side of the spectrum, the Scheduler could use advanced tech-\nniques such as machine learning to anticipate what kind of pods are about to be\nscheduled in the next minutes or hours and schedule pods to maximize future hard-\nware utilization without requiring any rescheduling of existing pods.

The Service controller is\nthe one requesting and releasing a load balancer from the infrastructure, when a\nLoadBalancer-type Service is created or deleted.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag354", "label": "table_flag354", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_355", "label": "325\nUnderstanding the architecture\nTHE ENDPOINTS CONTROLLER\nYou\u2019ll remember that Services aren\u2019t linked directly to pods, but instead contain a list\nof endpoints (IPs and ports), which is created and updated either manually or auto-\nmatically according to the pod selector defined on the Service. The Endpoints con-\ntroller is the active component that keeps the endpoint list constantly updated with\nthe IPs and ports of pods matching the label selector.\n As figure 11.7 shows, the controller watches both Services and Pods. When\nServices are added or updated or Pods are added, updated, or deleted, it selects Pods\nmatching the Service\u2019s pod selector and adds their IPs and ports to the Endpoints\nresource. Remember, the Endpoints object is a standalone object, so the controller\ncreates it if necessary. Likewise, it also deletes the Endpoints object when the Service is\ndeleted.\nTHE NAMESPACE CONTROLLER\nRemember namespaces (we talked about them in chapter 3)? Most resources belong\nto a specific namespace. When a Namespace resource is deleted, all the resources in\nthat namespace must also be deleted. This is what the Namespace controller does.\nWhen it\u2019s notified of the deletion of a Namespace object, it deletes all the resources\nbelonging to the namespace through the API server. \nTHE PERSISTENTVOLUME CONTROLLER\nIn chapter 6 you learned about PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims.\nOnce a user creates a PersistentVolumeClaim, Kubernetes must find an appropriate\nPersistentVolume and bind it to the claim. This is performed by the PersistentVolume\ncontroller. \n When a PersistentVolumeClaim pops up, the controller finds the best match for\nthe claim by selecting the smallest PersistentVolume with the access mode matching\nthe one requested in the claim and the declared capacity above the capacity requested\nController Manager\nWatches\nCreates, modi\ufb01es,\nand deletes\nEndpoints\ncontroller\nAPI server\nService resources\nPod resources\nEndpoints resources\nFigure 11.7\nThe Endpoints controller watches Service and Pod resources, \nand manages Endpoints.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "325\nUnderstanding the architecture\nTHE ENDPOINTS CONTROLLER\nYou\u2019ll remember that Services aren\u2019t linked directly to pods, but instead contain a list\nof endpoints (IPs and ports), which is created and updated either manually or auto-\nmatically according to the pod selector defined on the Service.

What does the Kubelet do exactly?\nUNDERSTANDING THE KUBELET\u2019S JOB\nIn a nutshell, the Kubelet is the component responsible for everything running on a\nworker node. Its initial job is to register the node it\u2019s running on by creating a Node\nresource in the API server. Then it needs to continuously monitor the API server for\nPods that have been scheduled to the node, and start the pod\u2019s containers. It does this\nby telling the configured container runtime (which is Docker, CoreOS\u2019 rkt, or some-\nthing else) to run a container from a specific container image. The Kubelet then con-\nstantly monitors running containers and reports their status, events, and resource\nconsumption to the API server. \n The Kubelet is also the component that runs the container liveness probes, restart-\ning containers when the probes fail. Lastly, it terminates containers when their Pod is\ndeleted from the API server and notifies the server that the pod has terminated.\nRUNNING STATIC PODS WITHOUT THE API SERVER\nAlthough the Kubelet talks to the Kubernetes API server and gets the pod manifests\nfrom there, it can also run pods based on pod manifest files in a specific local direc-\ntory as shown in figure 11.8. This feature is used to run the containerized versions of\nthe Control Plane components as pods, as you saw in the beginning of the chapter.\n Instead of running Kubernetes system components natively, you can put their pod\nmanifests into the Kubelet\u2019s manifest directory and have the Kubelet run and manage\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "326\nCHAPTER 11\nUnderstanding Kubernetes internals\nin the claim.

The service\u2019s IP address is specified\nas the nameserver in the /etc/resolv.conf file inside every container deployed in the\ncluster. The kube-dns pod uses the API server\u2019s watch mechanism to observe changes\nto Services and Endpoints and updates its DNS records with every change, allowing its\nclients to always get (fairly) up-to-date DNS information. I say fairly because during\nthe time between the update of the Service or Endpoints resource and the time the\nDNS pod receives the watch notification, the DNS records may be invalid.\nHOW (MOST) INGRESS CONTROLLERS WORK\nUnlike the DNS add-on, you\u2019ll find a few different implementations of Ingress con-\ntrollers, but most of them work in the same way. An Ingress controller runs a reverse\nproxy server (like Nginx, for example), and keeps it configured according to the\nIngress, Service, and Endpoints resources defined in the cluster.

The diagram doesn\u2019t include etcd, because\nit\u2019s hidden behind the API server, and you can think of the API server as the place\nwhere objects are stored.\nMaster node\nController Manager\nWatches\nDeployment\ncontroller\nScheduler\nReplicaSet\ncontroller\nAPI server\nDeployments\nPods\nReplicaSets\nWatches\nWatches\nNode X\nWatches\nDocker\nKubelet\nFigure 11.11\nKubernetes components watching API objects through the API server\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag360", "label": 1, "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "1"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_361", "label": "331\nHow controllers cooperate\n11.2.2 The chain of events\nImagine you prepared the YAML file containing the Deployment manifest and you\u2019re\nabout to submit it to Kubernetes through kubectl. kubectl sends the manifest to the\nKubernetes API server in an HTTP POST request.

How exactly does Kubernetes\nachieve this? In short, it doesn\u2019t. The network is set up by the system administrator or\nby a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin, not by Kubernetes itself. \n11.4.1 What the network must be like\nKubernetes doesn\u2019t require you to use a specific networking technology, but it does\nmandate that the pods (or to be more precise, their containers) can communicate\nwith each other, regardless if they\u2019re running on the same worker node or not. The\nnetwork the pods use to communicate must be such that the IP address a pod sees as\nits own is the exact same address that all other pods see as the IP address of the pod in\nquestion. \n Look at figure 11.14.

Then, each kube-proxy makes\nthat service addressable on the node it\u2019s running on.

We talked about them in chapter 5, but let me\nrefresh your memory, as it\u2019s easy to forget they even exist, because you rarely create\nthem manually. An Endpoints object holds the IP/port pairs of all the pods that back\nthe service (an IP/port pair can also point to something other than a pod). That\u2019s\nwhy the kube-proxy must also watch all Endpoints objects. After all, an Endpoints\nobject changes every time a new backing pod is created or deleted, and when the\npod\u2019s readiness status changes or the pod\u2019s labels change and it falls in or out of scope\nof the service. \n Now let\u2019s see how kube-proxy enables clients to connect to those pods through the\nService.

You\u2019ve already learned that the API server\nrequires clients to authenticate themselves before they\u2019re allowed to perform opera-\ntions on the server. And you\u2019ve already seen how pods can authenticate by sending the\ncontents of the file/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token, which\nis mounted into each container\u2019s filesystem through a secret volume.\n But what exactly does that file represent? Every pod is associated with a Service-\nAccount, which represents the identity of the app running in the pod. The token file\nholds the ServiceAccount\u2019s authentication token. When an app uses this token to con-\nnect to the API server, the authentication plugin authenticates the ServiceAccount\nand passes the ServiceAccount\u2019s username back to the API server core. Service-\nAccount usernames are formatted like this:\nsystem:serviceaccount:\u003cnamespace\u003e:\u003cservice account name\u003e\nThe API server passes this username to the configured authorization plugins, which\ndetermine whether the action the app is trying to perform is allowed to be performed\nby the ServiceAccount.\n ServiceAccounts are nothing more than a way for an application running inside a\npod to authenticate itself with the API server. As already mentioned, applications do\nthat by passing the ServiceAccount\u2019s token in the request.\nUNDERSTANDING THE SERVICEACCOUNT RESOURCE\nServiceAccounts are resources just like Pods, Secrets, ConfigMaps, and so on, and are\nscoped to individual namespaces. A default ServiceAccount is automatically created\nfor each namespace (that\u2019s the one your pods have used all along). \n You can list ServiceAccounts like you do other resources:\n$ kubectl get sa\nNAME      SECRETS   AGE\ndefault   1         1d\nNOTE\nThe shorthand for serviceaccount is sa.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "348\nCHAPTER 12\nSecuring the Kubernetes API server\n Groups returned by the plugin are nothing but strings, representing arbitrary\ngroup names, but built-in groups have special meaning:\n\uf0a1The system:unauthenticated group is used for requests where none of the\nauthentication plugins could authenticate the client.\n\uf0a1The system:authenticated group is automatically assigned to a user who was\nauthenticated successfully.\n\uf0a1The system:serviceaccounts group encompasses all ServiceAccounts in the\nsystem.\n\uf0a1The system:serviceaccounts:\u003cnamespace\u003e includes all ServiceAccounts in a\nspecific namespace.\n12.1.2 Introducing ServiceAccounts\nLet\u2019s explore ServiceAccounts up close.

As you can\nsee in figure 12.1, a pod can only use a ServiceAccount from the same namespace.\nUNDERSTANDING HOW SERVICEACCOUNTS TIE INTO AUTHORIZATION\nYou can assign a ServiceAccount to a pod by specifying the account\u2019s name in the pod\nmanifest. If you don\u2019t assign it explicitly, the pod will use the default ServiceAccount\nin the namespace.\n By assigning different ServiceAccounts to pods, you can control which resources\neach pod has access to. When a request bearing the authentication token is received\nby the API server, the server uses the token to authenticate the client sending the\nrequest and then determines whether or not the related ServiceAccount is allowed to\nperform the requested operation. The API server obtains this information from the\nsystem-wide authorization plugin configured by the cluster administrator. One of\nthe available authorization plugins is the role-based access control (RBAC) plugin,\nwhich is discussed later in this chapter. From Kubernetes version 1.6 on, the RBAC\nplugin is the plugin most clusters should use.\n12.1.3 Creating ServiceAccounts\nWe\u2019ve said every namespace contains its own default ServiceAccount, but additional\nones can be created if necessary. But why should you bother with creating Service-\nAccounts instead of using the default one for all your pods? \n The obvious reason is cluster security. Pods that don\u2019t need to read any cluster\nmetadata should run under a constrained account that doesn\u2019t allow them to retrieve\nor modify any resources deployed in the cluster. Pods that need to retrieve resource\nmetadata should run under a ServiceAccount that only allows reading those objects\u2019\nmetadata, whereas pods that need to modify those objects should run under their own\nServiceAccount allowing modifications of API objects. \nPod\nNamespace: foo\nService-\nAccount:\ndefault\nPod\nPod\nNamespace: baz\nPod\nNamespace: bar\nPod\nPod\nNot possible\nService-\nAccount:\ndefault\nAnother\nService-\nAccount\nMultiple pods using the\nsame ServiceAccount\nFigure 12.1\nEach pod is associated with a single ServiceAccount in the pod\u2019s namespace.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "349\nUnderstanding authentication\nAs you can see, the current namespace only contains the default ServiceAccount.

It allows read-\ning most resources in a namespace, except for Roles, RoleBindings, and Secrets. You\u2019re\nprobably wondering, why not Secrets? Because one of those Secrets might include an\nauthentication token with greater privileges than those defined in the view Cluster-\nRole and could allow the user to masquerade as a different user to gain additional\nprivileges (privilege escalation). \nALLOWING MODIFYING RESOURCES WITH THE EDIT CLUSTERROLE\nNext is the edit ClusterRole, which allows you to modify resources in a namespace,\nbut also allows both reading and modifying Secrets.

The main difference between the edit and the admin Cluster-\nRoles is in the ability to view and modify Roles and RoleBindings in the namespace.\nNOTE\nTo prevent privilege escalation, the API server only allows users to cre-\nate and update Roles if they already have all the permissions listed in that\nRole (and for the same scope). \nALLOWING COMPLETE CONTROL WITH THE CLUSTER-ADMIN CLUSTERROLE \nComplete control of the Kubernetes cluster can be given by assigning the cluster-\nadmin ClusterRole to a subject. As you\u2019ve seen before, the admin ClusterRole doesn\u2019t\nallow users to modify the namespace\u2019s ResourceQuota objects or the Namespace\nresource itself. If you want to allow a user to do that, you need to create a RoleBinding\nthat references the cluster-admin ClusterRole.

For example, the default capabilities given to a\ncontainer include the CAP_CHOWN capability, which allows processes to change the\nownership of files in the filesystem. \n You can see that\u2019s the case by changing the ownership of the /tmp directory in\nyour pod-with-defaults pod to the guest user, for example:\n$ kubectl exec pod-with-defaults chown guest /tmp\n$ kubectl exec pod-with-defaults -- ls -la / | grep tmp\ndrwxrwxrwt    2 guest    root             6 May 25 15:18 tmp\nCapabilities are added or dropped \nunder the securityContext property.\nYou\u2019re adding the \nSYS_TIME capability.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "385\nConfiguring the container\u2019s security context\n    command: [\"/bin/sleep\", \"999999\"]\n    securityContext:                     \n      capabilities:                      \n        add:                  \n        - SYS_TIME            \nNOTE\nLinux kernel capabilities are usually prefixed with CAP_.

Because of this, the mounted volume\nwill be owned by group ID 555, as shown here:\n/ $ ls -l / | grep volume\ndrwxrwsrwx    2 root     555              6 May 29 12:23 volume\nIf you create a file in the mounted volume\u2019s directory, the file is owned by user ID\n1111 (that\u2019s the user ID the container is running as) and by group ID 555:\n/ $ echo foo \u003e /volume/foo\n/ $ ls -l /volume\ntotal 4\n-rw-r--r--    1 1111     555              4 May 29 12:25 foo\nThis is different from how ownership is otherwise set up for newly created files.

Obviously, a mechanism must prevent users from doing part or\nall of what\u2019s been explained. The cluster admin can restrict the use of the previously\ndescribed security-related features by creating one or more PodSecurityPolicy\nresources.\n13.3.1 Introducing the PodSecurityPolicy resource\nPodSecurityPolicy is a cluster-level (non-namespaced) resource, which defines what\nsecurity-related features users can or can\u2019t use in their pods.

By who I mean which pods. Let\u2019s explore how to do this\nthrough an example. \n Imagine having a PostgreSQL database pod running in namespace foo and a web-\nserver pod that uses the database. Other pods are also in the namespace, and you\ndon\u2019t want to allow them to connect to the database. To secure the network, you need\nto create the NetworkPolicy resource shown in the following listing in the same name-\nspace as the database pod.\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n  name: postgres-netpolicy\nspec:\n  podSelector:                     \n    matchLabels:                   \n      app: database                \n  ingress:                           \n  - from:                            \n    - podSelector:                   \n        matchLabels:                 \n          app: webserver             \n    ports:                     \n    - port: 5432               \nThe example NetworkPolicy allows pods with the app=webserver label to connect to\npods with the app=database label, and only on port 5432. Other pods can\u2019t connect to\nthe database pods, and no one (not even the webserver pods) can connect to anything\nother than port 5432 of the database pods. This is shown in figure 13.4.\n Client pods usually connect to server pods through a Service instead of directly to\nthe pod, but that doesn\u2019t change anything.

When the pod starts, you can take a quick look at the pro-\ncess\u2019 CPU consumption by running the top command inside the container, as shown\nin the following listing.\nListing 14.1\nA pod with resource requests: requests-pod.yaml\nYou\u2019re specifying resource \nrequests for the main container.\nThe container requests 200 \nmillicores (that is, 1/5 of a \nsingle CPU core\u2019s time).\nThe container also\nrequests 10 mebibytes\nof memory.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag435", "label": "table_flag435", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_436", "label": "406\nCHAPTER 14\nManaging pods\u2019 computational resources\n$ kubectl exec -it requests-pod top\nMem: 1288116K used, 760368K free, 9196K shrd, 25748K buff, 814840K cached\nCPU:  9.1% usr 42.1% sys  0.0% nic 48.4% idle  0.0% io  0.0% irq  0.2% sirq\nLoad average: 0.79 0.52 0.29 2/481 10\n  PID  PPID USER     STAT   VSZ %VSZ CPU %CPU COMMAND\n    1     0 root     R     1192  0.0   1 50.2 dd if /dev/zero of /dev/null\n    7     0 root     R     1200  0.0   0  0.0 top\nThe dd command you\u2019re running in the container consumes as much CPU as it can,\nbut it only runs a single thread so it can only use a single core.

Likewise, the pod as a whole requested two CPUs, but the maximum\nis one CPU (if this was a multi-container pod, even if each individual container\nrequested less than the maximum amount of CPU, together they\u2019d still need to\nrequest less than two CPUs to pass the maximum CPU for pods). \n14.4.4 Applying default resource requests and limits\nNow let\u2019s also see how default resource requests and limits are set on containers that\ndon\u2019t specify them. Deploy the kubia-manual pod from chapter 3 again:\n$ kubectl create -f ../Chapter03/kubia-manual.yaml\npod \"kubia-manual\" created\nBefore you set up your LimitRange object, all your pods were created without any\nresource requests or limits, but now the defaults are applied automatically when creat-\ning the pod. You can confirm this by describing the kubia-manual pod, as shown in\nthe following listing.\n$ kubectl describe po kubia-manual\nName:           kubia-manual\n...\nContainers:\n  kubia:\n    Limits:\n      cpu:      200m\n      memory:   100Mi\n    Requests:\n      cpu:      100m\n      memory:   10Mi\nThe container\u2019s requests and limits match the ones you specified in the LimitRange\nobject. If you used a different LimitRange specification in another namespace, pods\ncreated in that namespace would obviously have different requests and limits. This\nallows admins to configure default, min, and max resources for pods per namespace.\nListing 14.12\nInspecting limits that were applied to a pod automatically\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag454", "label": "table_flag454", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_455", "label": "425\nLimiting the total resources available in a namespace\nIf namespaces are used to separate different teams or to separate development, QA,\nstaging, and production pods running in the same Kubernetes cluster, using a differ-\nent LimitRange in each namespace ensures large pods can only be created in certain\nnamespaces, whereas others are constrained to smaller pods.\n But remember, the limits configured in a LimitRange only apply to each individual\npod/container.

This is\nachieved by creating a ResourceQuota object. \n14.5.1 Introducing the ResourceQuota object\nIn chapter 10 we said that several Admission Control plugins running inside the API\nserver verify whether the pod may be created or not. In the previous section, I said\nthat the LimitRanger plugin enforces the policies configured in LimitRange resources.\nSimilarly, the ResourceQuota Admission Control plugin checks whether the pod\nbeing created would cause the configured ResourceQuota to be exceeded. If that\u2019s\nthe case, the pod\u2019s creation is rejected. Because resource quotas are enforced at pod\ncreation time, a ResourceQuota object only affects pods created after the Resource-\nQuota object is created\u2014creating it has no effect on existing pods.\n A ResourceQuota limits the amount of computational resources the pods and the\namount of storage PersistentVolumeClaims in a namespace can consume. It can also\nlimit the number of pods, claims, and other API objects users are allowed to create\ninside the namespace.

You\u2019ll have to add a CPU resource request to the Deployment\u2019s pod tem-\nplate, as shown in the following listing.\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: kubia\nspec:\n  replicas: 3                \n  template:\n    metadata:\n      name: kubia\n      labels:\n        app: kubia\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - image: luksa/kubia:v1     \n        name: nodejs\nListing 15.1\nDeployment with CPU requests set: deployment.yaml\nManually setting the \n(initial) desired number \nof replicas to three\nRunning the \nkubia:v1 image\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag472", "label": "table_flag472", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_473", "label": "443\nHorizontal pod autoscaling\n        resources:              \n          requests:             \n            cpu: 100m           \nThis is a regular Deployment object\u2014it doesn\u2019t use autoscaling yet.

The Autoscaler will constantly keep\nadjusting the number of replicas to keep their CPU utilization around 30%, but it will\nnever scale down to less than one or scale up to more than five replicas. \nTIP\nAlways make sure to autoscale Deployments instead of the underlying\nReplicaSets. This way, you ensure the desired replica count is preserved across\napplication updates (remember that a Deployment creates a new ReplicaSet\nfor each version).

The --rm option causes the pod to be deleted\nafterward, and the --restart=Never option causes kubectl run to create an unman-\naged pod directly instead of through a Deployment object, which you don\u2019t need.\nThis combination of options is useful for running commands inside the cluster with-\nout having to piggyback on an existing pod. It not only behaves the same as if you\nwere running the command locally, it even cleans up everything when the command\nterminates. \nSEEING THE AUTOSCALER SCALE UP THE DEPLOYMENT\nAs the load-generator pod runs, you\u2019ll see it initially hitting the single pod. As before,\nit takes time for the metrics to be updated, but when they are, you\u2019ll see the autoscaler\nincrease the number of replicas. In my case, the pod\u2019s CPU utilization initially jumped\nto 108%, which caused the autoscaler to increase the number of pods to four. The\nutilization on the individual pods then decreased to 74% and then stabilized at\naround 26%. \nNOTE\nIf the CPU load in your case doesn\u2019t exceed 30%, try running addi-\ntional load-generators.\nAgain, you can inspect autoscaler events with kubectl describe to see what the\nautoscaler has done (only the most important information is shown in the following\nlisting).\nFrom    Reason              Message\n----    ------              -------\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 1; reason: All metrics below target\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 4; reason: cpu resource utilization \n                            (percentage of request) above target\nDoes it strike you as odd that the initial average CPU utilization in my case, when I\nonly had one pod, was 108%, which is more than 100%? Remember, a container\u2019s\nCPU utilization is the container\u2019s actual CPU usage divided by its requested CPU. The\nrequested CPU defines the minimum, not maximum amount of CPU available to the\ncontainer, so a container may consume more than the requested CPU, bringing the\npercentage over 100. \n Before we go on, let\u2019s do a little math and see how the autoscaler concluded that\nfour replicas are needed.

You\u2019ve seen the -it\noption a few times when running the kubectl exec command. As you can see, it can\nalso be used with kubectl run. It allows you to attach the console to the process,\nwhich will not only show you the process\u2019 output directly, but will also terminate the\nprocess as soon as you press CTRL+C. The --rm option causes the pod to be deleted\nafterward, and the --restart=Never option causes kubectl run to create an unman-\naged pod directly instead of through a Deployment object, which you don\u2019t need.\nThis combination of options is useful for running commands inside the cluster with-\nout having to piggyback on an existing pod. It not only behaves the same as if you\nwere running the command locally, it even cleans up everything when the command\nterminates. \nSEEING THE AUTOSCALER SCALE UP THE DEPLOYMENT\nAs the load-generator pod runs, you\u2019ll see it initially hitting the single pod. As before,\nit takes time for the metrics to be updated, but when they are, you\u2019ll see the autoscaler\nincrease the number of replicas. In my case, the pod\u2019s CPU utilization initially jumped\nto 108%, which caused the autoscaler to increase the number of pods to four. The\nutilization on the individual pods then decreased to 74% and then stabilized at\naround 26%. \nNOTE\nIf the CPU load in your case doesn\u2019t exceed 30%, try running addi-\ntional load-generators.\nAgain, you can inspect autoscaler events with kubectl describe to see what the\nautoscaler has done (only the most important information is shown in the following\nlisting).\nFrom    Reason              Message\n----    ------              -------\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 1; reason: All metrics below target\nh-p-a   SuccessfulRescale   New size: 4; reason: cpu resource utilization \n                            (percentage of request) above target\nDoes it strike you as odd that the initial average CPU utilization in my case, when I\nonly had one pod, was 108%, which is more than 100%? Remember, a container\u2019s\nCPU utilization is the container\u2019s actual CPU usage divided by its requested CPU. The\nrequested CPU defines the minimum, not maximum amount of CPU available to the\ncontainer, so a container may consume more than the requested CPU, bringing the\npercentage over 100. \n Before we go on, let\u2019s do a little math and see how the autoscaler concluded that\nfour replicas are needed. Initially, there was one replica handling requests and its\nCPU usage spiked to 108%. Dividing 108 by 30 (the target CPU utilization percent-\nage) gives 3.6, which the autoscaler then rounded up to 4.

For example, you may\nwant to scale pods according to a metric of another cluster object, such as an Ingress\nobject. The metric could be QPS as in listing 15.8, the average request latency, or\nsomething else completely. \n Unlike in the previous case, where the autoscaler needed to obtain the metric for\nall targeted pods and then use the average of those values, when you use an Object\nmetric type, the autoscaler obtains a single metric from the single object.

Allowing the number of pods to be scaled down to zero can dramatically\nincrease the utilization of your hardware. When you run services that get requests only\nonce every few hours or even days, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have them running all the\ntime, eating up resources that could be used by other pods. But you still want to have\nthose services available immediately when a client request comes in. \n This is known as idling and un-idling. It allows pods that provide a certain service\nto be scaled down to zero. When a new request comes in, the request is blocked until\nthe pod is brought up and then the request is finally forwarded to the pod. \n Kubernetes currently doesn\u2019t provide this feature yet, but it will eventually. Check\nthe documentation to see if idling has been implemented yet. \n15.2\nVertical pod autoscaling\nHorizontal scaling is great, but not every application can be scaled horizontally. For\nsuch applications, the only option is to scale them vertically\u2014give them more CPU\nand/or memory. Because a node usually has more resources than a single pod\nrequests, it should almost always be possible to scale a pod vertically, right? \n Because a pod\u2019s resource requests are configured through fields in the pod\nmanifest, vertically scaling a pod would be performed by changing those fields. I\nsay \u201cwould\u201d because it\u2019s currently not possible to change either resource requests\nor limits of existing pods. Before I started writing the book (well over a year ago), I\nwas sure that by the time I wrote this chapter, Kubernetes would already support\nproper vertical pod autoscaling, so I included it in my proposal for the table of con-\ntents. Sadly, what seems like a lifetime later, vertical pod autoscaling is still not\navailable yet. \n15.2.1 Automatically configuring resource requests\nAn experimental feature sets the CPU and memory requests on newly created pods, if\ntheir containers don\u2019t have them set explicitly. The feature is provided by an Admission\nControl plugin called InitialResources. When a new pod without resource requests is\ncreated, the plugin looks at historical resource usage data of the pod\u2019s containers (per\nthe underlying container image and tag) and sets the requests accordingly. \n You can deploy pods without specifying resource requests and rely on Kubernetes\nto eventually figure out what each container\u2019s resource needs are. Effectively, Kuber-\nnetes is vertically scaling the pod. For example, if a container keeps running out of\nmemory, the next time a pod with that container image is created, its resource request\nfor memory will be set higher automatically.\n15.2.2 Modifying resource requests while a pod is running\nEventually, the same mechanism will be used to modify an existing pod\u2019s resource\nrequests, which means it will vertically scale the pod while it\u2019s running.

Allowing the number of pods to be scaled down to zero can dramatically\nincrease the utilization of your hardware. When you run services that get requests only\nonce every few hours or even days, it doesn\u2019t make sense to have them running all the\ntime, eating up resources that could be used by other pods. But you still want to have\nthose services available immediately when a client request comes in. \n This is known as idling and un-idling. It allows pods that provide a certain service\nto be scaled down to zero. When a new request comes in, the request is blocked until\nthe pod is brought up and then the request is finally forwarded to the pod. \n Kubernetes currently doesn\u2019t provide this feature yet, but it will eventually. Check\nthe documentation to see if idling has been implemented yet. \n15.2\nVertical pod autoscaling\nHorizontal scaling is great, but not every application can be scaled horizontally. For\nsuch applications, the only option is to scale them vertically\u2014give them more CPU\nand/or memory. Because a node usually has more resources than a single pod\nrequests, it should almost always be possible to scale a pod vertically, right? \n Because a pod\u2019s resource requests are configured through fields in the pod\nmanifest, vertically scaling a pod would be performed by changing those fields. I\nsay \u201cwould\u201d because it\u2019s currently not possible to change either resource requests\nor limits of existing pods. Before I started writing the book (well over a year ago), I\nwas sure that by the time I wrote this chapter, Kubernetes would already support\nproper vertical pod autoscaling, so I included it in my proposal for the table of con-\ntents. Sadly, what seems like a lifetime later, vertical pod autoscaling is still not\navailable yet. \n15.2.1 Automatically configuring resource requests\nAn experimental feature sets the CPU and memory requests on newly created pods, if\ntheir containers don\u2019t have them set explicitly. The feature is provided by an Admission\nControl plugin called InitialResources. When a new pod without resource requests is\ncreated, the plugin looks at historical resource usage data of the pod\u2019s containers (per\nthe underlying container image and tag) and sets the requests accordingly. \n You can deploy pods without specifying resource requests and rely on Kubernetes\nto eventually figure out what each container\u2019s resource needs are. Effectively, Kuber-\nnetes is vertically scaling the pod. For example, if a container keeps running out of\nmemory, the next time a pod with that container image is created, its resource request\nfor memory will be set higher automatically.\n15.2.2 Modifying resource requests while a pod is running\nEventually, the same mechanism will be used to modify an existing pod\u2019s resource\nrequests, which means it will vertically scale the pod while it\u2019s running.

If\nthat five-minute delay is too long for your pods, you can make the delay shorter by\nadding those two tolerations to the pod\u2019s spec.\nNOTE\nThis is currently an alpha feature, so it may change in future versions\nof Kubernetes.

Now you\u2019ll\nlearn about a newer mechanism called node affinity, which allows you to tell Kuberne-\ntes to schedule pods only to specific subsets of nodes.\nCOMPARING NODE AFFINITY TO NODE SELECTORS\nThe initial node affinity mechanism in early versions of Kubernetes was the node-\nSelector field in the pod specification.

If you look at the tolerations of one of your pods, you\u2019ll see\ntwo tolerations, which are shown in the following listing.\n$ kubectl get po prod-350605-1ph5h -o yaml\n...\n  tolerations:\n  - effect: NoExecute                            \n    key: node.alpha.kubernetes.io/notReady       \n    operator: Exists                             \n    tolerationSeconds: 300                       \n  - effect: NoExecute                              \n    key: node.alpha.kubernetes.io/unreachable      \n    operator: Exists                               \n    tolerationSeconds: 300                         \nThese two tolerations say that this pod tolerates a node being notReady or unreach-\nable for 300 seconds. The Kubernetes Control Plane, when it detects that a node is no\nlonger ready or no longer reachable, will wait for 300 seconds before it deletes the\npod and reschedules it to another node.\n These two tolerations are automatically added to pods that don\u2019t define them. If\nthat five-minute delay is too long for your pods, you can make the delay shorter by\nadding those two tolerations to the pod\u2019s spec.\nNOTE\nThis is currently an alpha feature, so it may change in future versions\nof Kubernetes. Taint-based evictions also aren\u2019t enabled by default. You enable\nthem by running the Controller Manager with the --feature-gates=Taint-\nBasedEvictions=true option.\n16.2\nUsing node affinity to attract pods to certain nodes\nAs you\u2019ve learned, taints are used to keep pods away from certain nodes. Now you\u2019ll\nlearn about a newer mechanism called node affinity, which allows you to tell Kuberne-\ntes to schedule pods only to specific subsets of nodes.\nCOMPARING NODE AFFINITY TO NODE SELECTORS\nThe initial node affinity mechanism in early versions of Kubernetes was the node-\nSelector field in the pod specification. The node had to include all the labels speci-\nfied in that field to be eligible to become the target for the pod. \n Node selectors get the job done and are simple, but they don\u2019t offer everything\nthat you may need. Because of that, a more powerful mechanism was introduced.\nListing 16.6\nPod with default tolerations\nThe pod tolerates the node being \nnotReady for 300 seconds, before \nit needs to be rescheduled.\nThe same applies to the \nnode being unreachable.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag492", "label": "table_flag492", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_493", "label": "463\nUsing node affinity to attract pods to certain nodes\nNode selectors will eventually be deprecated, so it\u2019s important you understand the\nnew node affinity rules.\n Similar to node selectors, each pod can define its own node affinity rules. These\nallow you to specify either hard requirements or preferences. By specifying a prefer-\nence, you tell Kubernetes which nodes you prefer for a specific pod, and Kubernetes\nwill try to schedule the pod to one of those nodes. If that\u2019s not possible, it will choose\none of the other nodes. \nEXAMINING THE DEFAULT NODE LABELS\nNode affinity selects nodes based on their labels, the same way node selectors do.\nBefore you see how to use node affinity, let\u2019s examine the labels of one of the nodes in\na Google Kubernetes Engine cluster (GKE) to see what the default node labels are.\nThey\u2019re shown in the following listing.\n$ kubectl describe node gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\nName:     gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf\nRole:\nLabels:   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64\n          beta.kubernetes.io/fluentd-ds-ready=true\n          beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=f1-micro\n          beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux\n          cloud.google.com/gke-nodepool=default-pool\n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=europe-west1         \n          failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=europe-west1-d         \n          kubernetes.io/hostname=gke-kubia-default-pool-db274c5a-mjnf   \nThe node has many labels, but the last three are the most important when it comes to\nnode affinity and pod affinity, which you\u2019ll learn about later. The meaning of those\nthree labels is as follows:\n\uf0a1\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region specifies the geographical region\nthe node is located in.\n\uf0a1\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone specifies the availability zone the\nnode is in.\n\uf0a1\nkubernetes.io/hostname is obviously the node\u2019s hostname.\nThese and other labels can be used in pod affinity rules. In chapter 3, you already\nlearned how you can add a custom label to nodes and use it in a pod\u2019s node selector.\nYou used the custom label to deploy pods only to nodes with that label by adding a node\nselector to the pods. Now, you\u2019ll see how to do the same using node affinity rules.\n16.2.1 Specifying hard node affinity rules\nIn the example in chapter 3, you used the node selector to deploy a pod that requires\na GPU only to nodes that have a GPU.

You probably don\u2019t want all your frontend pods to\nrun on the same machine, but you\u2019d still like to keep them close to the backend\npod\u2014for example, run them in the same availability zone. \nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME AVAILABILITY ZONE\nThe cluster I\u2019m using runs in three VMs on my local machine, so all the nodes are in\nthe same availability zone, so to speak. But if the nodes were in different zones, all I\u2019d\nneed to do to run the frontend pods in the same zone as the backend pod would be to\nchange the topologyKey property to failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone. \nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL REGION\nTo allow the pods to be deployed in the same region instead of the same zone (cloud\nproviders usually have datacenters located in different geographical regions and split\ninto multiple availability zones in each region), the topologyKey would be set to\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region.\nUNDERSTANDING HOW TOPOLOGYKEY WORKS\nThe way topologyKey works is simple. The three keys we\u2019ve mentioned so far aren\u2019t\nspecial. If you want, you can easily use your own topologyKey, such as rack, to have\nthe pods scheduled to the same server rack. The only prerequisite is to add a rack\nlabel to your nodes. This scenario is shown in figure 16.5.\n For example, if you had 20 nodes, with 10 in each rack, you\u2019d label the first ten as\nrack=rack1 and the others as rack=rack2. Then, when defining a pod\u2019s podAffinity,\nyou\u2019d set the toplogyKey to rack. \n When the Scheduler is deciding where to deploy a pod, it checks the pod\u2019s pod-\nAffinity config, finds the pods that match the label selector, and looks up the nodes\nthey\u2019re running on. Specifically, it looks up the nodes\u2019 label whose key matches the\ntopologyKey field specified in podAffinity. Then it selects all the nodes whose label\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "471\nCo-locating pods with pod affinity and anti-affinity\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node1.k8s: Taint Toleration Priority, Score: (10)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node2.k8s: InterPodAffinityPriority, Score: (10)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node1.k8s: InterPodAffinityPriority, Score: (0)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node2.k8s: SelectorSpreadPriority, Score: (10)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node1.k8s: SelectorSpreadPriority, Score: (10)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node2.k8s: NodeAffinityPriority, Score: (0)\n... backend-qhqj6 -\u003e node1.k8s: NodeAffinityPriority, Score: (0)\n...

You probably don\u2019t want all your frontend pods to\nrun on the same machine, but you\u2019d still like to keep them close to the backend\npod\u2014for example, run them in the same availability zone. \nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME AVAILABILITY ZONE\nThe cluster I\u2019m using runs in three VMs on my local machine, so all the nodes are in\nthe same availability zone, so to speak. But if the nodes were in different zones, all I\u2019d\nneed to do to run the frontend pods in the same zone as the backend pod would be to\nchange the topologyKey property to failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone. \nCO-LOCATING PODS IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHICAL REGION\nTo allow the pods to be deployed in the same region instead of the same zone (cloud\nproviders usually have datacenters located in different geographical regions and split\ninto multiple availability zones in each region), the topologyKey would be set to\nfailure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region.\nUNDERSTANDING HOW TOPOLOGYKEY WORKS\nThe way topologyKey works is simple. The three keys we\u2019ve mentioned so far aren\u2019t\nspecial. If you want, you can easily use your own topologyKey, such as rack, to have\nthe pods scheduled to the same server rack. The only prerequisite is to add a rack\nlabel to your nodes.

Then it selects all the nodes whose label\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag501", "label": "table_flag501", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_502", "label": "472\nCHAPTER 16\nAdvanced scheduling\nmatches the values of the pods it found earlier. In figure 16.5, the label selector\nmatched the backend pod, which runs on Node 12. The value of the rack label on\nthat node equals rack2, so when scheduling a frontend pod, the Scheduler will only\nselect among the nodes that have the rack=rack2 label.\nNOTE\nBy default, the label selector only matches pods in the same name-\nspace as the pod that\u2019s being scheduled. But you can also select pods from\nother namespaces by adding a namespaces field at the same level as label-\nSelector.\n16.3.3 Expressing pod affinity preferences instead of hard requirements\nEarlier, when we talked about node affinity, you saw that nodeAffinity can be used to\nexpress a hard requirement, which means a pod is only scheduled to nodes that match\nthe node affinity rules. It can also be used to specify node preferences, to instruct the\nScheduler to schedule the pod to certain nodes, while allowing it to schedule it any-\nwhere else if those nodes can\u2019t fit the pod for any reason.\n The same also applies to podAffinity. You can tell the Scheduler you\u2019d prefer to\nhave your frontend pods scheduled onto the same node as your backend pod, but if\nthat\u2019s not possible, you\u2019re okay with them being scheduled elsewhere.

This means\napplication developers need to make sure their apps allow being moved relatively\noften. \nEXPECTING THE LOCAL IP AND HOSTNAME TO CHANGE\nWhen a pod is killed and run elsewhere (technically, it\u2019s a new pod instance replac-\ning the old one; the pod isn\u2019t relocated), it not only has a new IP address but also a\nnew name and hostname. Most stateless apps can usually handle this without any\nadverse effects, but stateful apps usually can\u2019t. We\u2019ve learned that stateful apps can\nbe run through a StatefulSet, which ensures that when the app starts up on a new\nnode after being rescheduled, it will still see the same host name and persistent state\nas before. The pod\u2019s IP will change nevertheless. Apps need to be prepared for that\nto happen. The application developer therefore should never base membership in a\nclustered app on the member\u2019s IP address, and if basing it on the hostname, should\nalways use a StatefulSet.\nEXPECTING THE DATA WRITTEN TO DISK TO DISAPPEAR\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that if the app writes data to disk, that data may not be\navailable after the app is started inside a new pod, unless you mount persistent storage at\nthe location the app is writing to. It should be clear this happens when the pod is\nrescheduled, but files written to disk will disappear even in scenarios that don\u2019t involve\nany rescheduling. Even during the lifetime of a single pod, the files written to disk by\nthe app running in the pod may disappear. Let me explain this with an example.\n Imagine an app that has a long and computationally intensive initial startup proce-\ndure. To help the app come up faster on subsequent startups, the developers make\nthe app cache the results of the initial startup on disk (an example of this would be\nthe scanning of all Java classes for annotations at startup and then writing the results\nto an index file). Because apps in Kubernetes run in containers by default, these files\nare written to the container\u2019s filesystem. If the container is then restarted, they\u2019re all\nlost, because the new container starts off with a completely new writable layer (see fig-\nure 17.2).\n Don\u2019t forget that individual containers may be restarted for several reasons, such\nas because the process crashes, because the liveness probe returned a failure, or\nbecause the node started running out of memory and the process was killed by the\nOOMKiller. When this happens, the pod is still the same, but the container itself is\ncompletely new. The Kubelet doesn\u2019t run the same container again; it always creates a\nnew container. \nUSING VOLUMES TO PRESERVE DATA ACROSS CONTAINER RESTARTS\nWhen its container is restarted, the app in the example will need to perform the\nintensive startup procedure again. This may or may not be desired. To make sure data\nlike this isn\u2019t lost, you need to use at least a pod-scoped volume.

If you cre-\nate a ReplicaSet with a desired replica count of three, and then one of the containers\nin one of those pods starts crashing, Kubernetes will not delete and replace the pod.\nThe end result is a ReplicaSet with only two properly running replicas instead of the\ndesired three (figure 17.4).\nYou\u2019d probably expect the pod to be deleted and replaced with another pod instance\nthat might run successfully on another node. After all, the container may be crashing\nbecause of a node-related problem that doesn\u2019t manifest itself on other nodes. Sadly,\nthat isn\u2019t the case.

This is not recommended for at least the following two reasons:\n\uf0a1A container terminating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the whole pod is being\nterminated.\n\uf0a1You have no guarantee the shut-down procedure will finish before the process\nis killed.\nThis second scenario doesn\u2019t happen only when the grace period runs out before the\napplication has finished shutting down gracefully, but also when the node running\nthe pod fails in the middle of the container shut-down sequence. Even if the node\nthen starts up again, the Kubelet will not restart the shut-down procedure (it won\u2019t\neven start up the container again). There are absolutely no guarantees that the pod\nwill be allowed to complete its whole shut-down procedure.\nREPLACING CRITICAL SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURES WITH DEDICATED SHUT-DOWN PROCEDURE PODS\nHow do you ensure that a critical shut-down procedure that absolutely must run to\ncompletion does run to completion (for example, to ensure that a pod\u2019s data is\nmigrated to other pods)?\n One solution is for the app (upon receipt of a termination signal) to create a new\nJob resource that would run a new pod, whose sole job is to migrate the deleted pod\u2019s\ndata to the remaining pods. But if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you\u2019ll know that you\nhave no guarantee the app will indeed manage to create the Job object every single\ntime. What if the node fails exactly when the app tries to do that? \n The proper way to handle this problem is by having a dedicated, constantly run-\nning pod that keeps checking for the existence of orphaned data. When this pod finds\nthe orphaned data, it can migrate it to the remaining pods. Rather than a constantly\nrunning pod, you can also use a CronJob resource and run the pod periodically. \n You may think StatefulSets could help here, but they don\u2019t. As you\u2019ll remember,\nscaling down a StatefulSet leaves PersistentVolumeClaims orphaned, leaving the data\nstored on the PersistentVolume stranded. Yes, upon a subsequent scale-up, the Persistent-\nVolume will be reattached to the new pod instance, but what if that scale-up never\nhappens (or happens after a long time)? For this reason, you may want to run a\ndata-migrating pod also when using StatefulSets (this scenario is shown in figure 17.6).\nTo prevent the migration from occurring during an application upgrade, the data-\nmigrating pod could be configured to wait a while to give the stateful pod time to\ncome up again before performing the migration.\n \n \n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "491\nUnderstanding the pod\u2019s lifecycle\npod needs to migrate all its data to the remaining pods to make sure it\u2019s not lost.\nShould the pod start migrating the data upon receiving a termination signal (through\neither the SIGTERM signal or through a pre-stop hook)? \n Absolutely not!

What if the node fails exactly when the app tries to do that? \n The proper way to handle this problem is by having a dedicated, constantly run-\nning pod that keeps checking for the existence of orphaned data. When this pod finds\nthe orphaned data, it can migrate it to the remaining pods. Rather than a constantly\nrunning pod, you can also use a CronJob resource and run the pod periodically. \n You may think StatefulSets could help here, but they don\u2019t. As you\u2019ll remember,\nscaling down a StatefulSet leaves PersistentVolumeClaims orphaned, leaving the data\nstored on the PersistentVolume stranded. Yes, upon a subsequent scale-up, the Persistent-\nVolume will be reattached to the new pod instance, but what if that scale-up never\nhappens (or happens after a long time)? For this reason, you may want to run a\ndata-migrating pod also when using StatefulSets (this scenario is shown in figure 17.6).\nTo prevent the migration from occurring during an application upgrade, the data-\nmigrating pod could be configured to wait a while to give the stateful pod time to\ncome up again before performing the migration.\n \n \n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag521", "label": "table_flag521", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_522", "label": "492\nCHAPTER 17\nBest practices for developing apps\n17.3\nEnsuring all client requests are handled properly\nYou now have a good sense of how to make pods shut down cleanly.

Even if initially all your pod replicas run the same image version, if\nyou push a new version of the image under the latest tag, and then pods are resched-\nuled (or you scale up your Deployment), the new pods will run the new version,\nwhereas the old ones will still be running the old one.

If it uses the ServiceAccount\u2019s token to authenticate itself, you\ncan always copy the ServiceAccount\u2019s Secret\u2019s files to your local machine with kubectl\ncp. The API server doesn\u2019t care if the client accessing it is inside or outside the cluster. \n If the app uses an ambassador container like the one described in chapter 8, you\ndon\u2019t even need those Secret files. Run kubectl proxy on your local machine, run\nyour app locally, and it should be ready to talk to your local kubectl proxy (as long as\nit and the ambassador container bind the proxy to the same port).\n In this case, you\u2019ll need to make sure the user account your local kubectl is using\nhas the same privileges as the ServiceAccount the app will run under.\nRUNNING INSIDE A CONTAINER EVEN DURING DEVELOPMENT\nWhen during development you absolutely have to run the app in a container for what-\never reason, there is a way of avoiding having to build the container image every time.\nInstead of baking the binaries into the image, you can always mount your local filesys-\ntem into the container through Docker volumes, for example. This way, after you\nbuild a new version of the app\u2019s binaries, all you need to do is restart the container (or\nnot even that, if hot-redeploy is supported). No need to rebuild the image.\n17.5.2 Using Minikube in development\nAs you can see, nothing forces you to run your app inside Kubernetes during develop-\nment. But you may do that anyway to see how the app behaves in a true Kubernetes\nenvironment.\n You may have used Minikube to run examples in this book. Although a Minikube\ncluster runs only a single worker node, it\u2019s nevertheless a valuable method of trying\nout your app in Kubernetes (and, of course, developing all the resource manifests that\nmake up your complete application). Minikube doesn\u2019t offer everything that a proper\nmulti-node Kubernetes cluster usually provides, but in most cases, that doesn\u2019t matter.\nMOUNTING LOCAL FILES INTO THE MINIKUBE VM AND THEN INTO YOUR CONTAINERS\nWhen you\u2019re developing with Minikube and you\u2019d like to try out every change to your\napp in your Kubernetes cluster, you can mount your local filesystem into the Minikube\nVM using the minikube mount command and then mount it into your containers\nthrough a hostPath volume. You\u2019ll find additional instructions on how to do that\nin the Minikube documentation at https:/\n/github.com/kubernetes/minikube/tree/\nmaster/docs.\nUSING THE DOCKER DAEMON INSIDE THE MINIKUBE VM TO BUILD YOUR IMAGES\nIf you\u2019re developing your app with Minikube and planning to build the container\nimage after every change, you can use the Docker daemon inside the Minikube VM to\ndo the building, instead of having to build the image through your local Docker dae-\nmon, push it to a registry, and then have it pulled by the daemon in the VM.

The aim of this chapter was to\n\uf0a1Show you how all the resources covered in this book come together to repre-\nsent a typical application running in Kubernetes.\n\uf0a1Make you think about the difference between apps that are rarely moved\nbetween machines and apps running as pods, which are relocated much more\nfrequently.\n\uf0a1Help you understand that your multi-component apps (or microservices, if you\nwill) shouldn\u2019t rely on a specific start-up order.\n\uf0a1Introduce init containers, which can be used to initialize a pod or delay the start\nof the pod\u2019s main containers until a precondition is met.\n\uf0a1Teach you about container lifecycle hooks and when to use them.\n\uf0a1Gain a deeper insight into the consequences of the distributed nature of\nKubernetes components and its eventual consistency model.\n\uf0a1Learn how to make your apps shut down properly without breaking client\nconnections.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag536", "label": "table_flag536", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_537", "label": "507\nSummary\n\uf0a1Give you a few small tips on how to make your apps easier to manage by keep-\ning image sizes small, adding annotations and multi-dimensional labels to all\nyour resources, and making it easier to see why an application terminated.\n\uf0a1Teach you how to develop Kubernetes apps and run them locally or in Mini-\nkube before deploying them on a proper multi-node cluster.\nIn the next and final chapter, we\u2019ll learn how you can extend Kubernetes with your\nown custom API objects and controllers and how others have done it to create com-\nplete Platform-as-a-Service solutions on top of Kubernetes.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "507\nSummary\n\uf0a1Give you a few small tips on how to make your apps easier to manage by keep-\ning image sizes small, adding annotations and multi-dimensional labels to all\nyour resources, and making it easier to see why an application terminated.\n\uf0a1Teach you how to develop Kubernetes apps and run them locally or in Mini-\nkube before deploying them on a proper multi-node cluster.\nIn the next and final chapter, we\u2019ll learn how you can extend Kubernetes with your\nown custom API objects and controllers and how others have done it to create com-\nplete Platform-as-a-Service solutions on top of Kubernetes.\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag537", "label": "table_flag537", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_538", "label": "508\nExtending Kubernetes\nYou\u2019re almost done.

Certain custom objects are used to store data\ninstead of using a more generic mechanism such as a ConfigMap. Applications run-\nning inside pods can query the API server for those objects and read whatever is\nstored in them. \n But in this case, we said you wanted the existence of a Website object to result in\nthe spinning up of a web server serving the contents of the Git repository referenced\nin the object. We\u2019ll look at how to do that next.\n18.1.2 Automating custom resources with custom controllers\nTo make your Website objects run a web server pod exposed through a Service, you\u2019ll\nneed to build and deploy a Website controller, which will watch the API server for the\ncreation of Website objects and then create the Service and the web server Pod for\neach of them. \n To make sure the Pod is managed and survives node failures, the controller will\ncreate a Deployment resource instead of an unmanaged Pod directly. The controller\u2019s\noperation is summarized in figure 18.2.\nI\u2019ve written a simple initial version of the controller, which works well enough to\nshow CRDs and the controller in action, but it\u2019s far from being production-ready,\nbecause it\u2019s overly simplified.

You\u2019d want the API server to validate the object and\nreject invalid objects immediately. Validation of custom objects was introduced in\nKubernetes version 1.8 as an alpha feature. To have the API server validate your cus-\ntom objects, you need to enable the CustomResourceValidation feature gate in the\nAPI server and specify a JSON schema in the CRD.\n18.1.4 Providing a custom API server for your custom objects\nA better way of adding support for custom objects in Kubernetes is to implement your\nown API server and have the clients talk directly to it. \nINTRODUCING API SERVER AGGREGATION\nIn Kubernetes version 1.7, you can integrate your custom API server with the main\nKubernetes API server, through API server aggregation. Initially, the Kubernetes API\nserver was a single monolithic component. From Kubernetes version 1.7, multiple\naggregated API servers will be exposed at a single location. Clients can connect to the\naggregated API and have their requests transparently forwarded to the appropriate\nAPI server. This way, the client wouldn\u2019t even be aware that multiple API servers han-\ndle different objects behind the scenes. Even the core Kubernetes API server may\neventually end up being split into multiple smaller API servers and exposed as a single\nserver through the aggregator, as shown in figure 18.5.\nIn your case, you could create an API server responsible for handling your Website\nobjects. It could validate those objects the way the core Kubernetes API server validates\nthem. You\u2019d no longer need to create a CRD to represent those objects, because you\u2019d\nimplement the Website object type into the custom API server directly. \n Generally, each API server is responsible for storing their own resources. As shown\nin figure 18.5, it can either run its own instance of etcd (or a whole etcd cluster), or it\nMain\nAPI server\nCustom\nAPI server Y\nCustom\nAPI server X\nkubectl\nUses its own etcd instance\nfor storing its resources\nUses CustomResourceDe\ufb01nitions\nin main API server as storage\nmechanism\netcd\netcd\nFigure 18.5\nAPI server aggregation\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "518\nCHAPTER 18\nExtending Kubernetes\nto notice the error message by querying the API server for the Website object.

To have the API server validate your cus-\ntom objects, you need to enable the CustomResourceValidation feature gate in the\nAPI server and specify a JSON schema in the CRD.\n18.1.4 Providing a custom API server for your custom objects\nA better way of adding support for custom objects in Kubernetes is to implement your\nown API server and have the clients talk directly to it. \nINTRODUCING API SERVER AGGREGATION\nIn Kubernetes version 1.7, you can integrate your custom API server with the main\nKubernetes API server, through API server aggregation. Initially, the Kubernetes API\nserver was a single monolithic component. From Kubernetes version 1.7, multiple\naggregated API servers will be exposed at a single location. Clients can connect to the\naggregated API and have their requests transparently forwarded to the appropriate\nAPI server. This way, the client wouldn\u2019t even be aware that multiple API servers han-\ndle different objects behind the scenes. Even the core Kubernetes API server may\neventually end up being split into multiple smaller API servers and exposed as a single\nserver through the aggregator, as shown in figure 18.5.\nIn your case, you could create an API server responsible for handling your Website\nobjects. It could validate those objects the way the core Kubernetes API server validates\nthem. You\u2019d no longer need to create a CRD to represent those objects, because you\u2019d\nimplement the Website object type into the custom API server directly. \n Generally, each API server is responsible for storing their own resources. As shown\nin figure 18.5, it can either run its own instance of etcd (or a whole etcd cluster), or it\nMain\nAPI server\nCustom\nAPI server Y\nCustom\nAPI server X\nkubectl\nUses its own etcd instance\nfor storing its resources\nUses CustomResourceDe\ufb01nitions\nin main API server as storage\nmechanism\netcd\netcd\nFigure 18.5\nAPI server aggregation\n \n"}, {"color": "green", "id": "table_flag548", "label": "table_flag548", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "0"}, {"color": "violet", "id": "text_549", "label": "519\nExtending Kubernetes with the Kubernetes Service Catalog\ncan store its resources in the core API server\u2019s etcd store by creating CRD instances in\nthe core API server. In that case, it needs to create a CRD object first, before creating\ninstances of the CRD, the way you did in the example.\nREGISTERING A CUSTOM API SERVER\nTo add a custom API server to your cluster, you\u2019d deploy it as a pod and expose it\nthrough a Service. Then, to integrate it into the main API server, you\u2019d deploy a YAML\nmanifest describing an APIService resource like the one in the following listing.\napiVersion: apiregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1   \nkind: APIService                             \nmetadata:\n  name: v1alpha1.extensions.example.com\nspec:\n  group: extensions.example.com           \n  version: v1alpha1                      \n  priority: 150\n  service:                    \n    name: website-api         \n    namespace: default        \nAfter creating the APIService resource from the previous listing, client requests sent\nto the main API server that contain any resource from the extensions.example.com\nAPI group and version v1alpha1 would be forwarded to the custom API server pod(s)\nexposed through the website-api Service. \nCREATING CUSTOM CLIENTS\nWhile you can create custom resources from YAML files using the regular kubectl cli-\nent, to make deployment of custom objects even easier, in addition to providing a cus-\ntom API server, you can also build a custom CLI tool. This will allow you to add\ndedicated commands for manipulating those objects, similar to how kubectl allows\ncreating Secrets, Deployments, and other resources through resource-specific com-\nmands like kubectl create secret or kubectl create deployment.\n As I\u2019ve already mentioned, custom API servers, API server aggregation, and other\nfeatures related to extending Kubernetes are currently being worked on intensively, so\nthey may change after the book is published.

This is done by creating a resource called Build-\nConfig, which can be configured to trigger builds of container images immediately\nafter a change is committed to the source Git repository. \n Although OpenShift doesn\u2019t monitor the Git repository itself, a hook in the repos-\nitory can notify OpenShift of the new commit. OpenShift will then pull the changes\nfrom the Git repository and start the build process. A build mechanism called Source\nTo Image can detect what type of application is in the Git repository and run the\nproper build procedure for it. For example, if it detects a pom.xml file, which is used\nin Java Maven-formatted projects, it runs a Maven build. The resulting artifacts are\npackaged into an appropriate container image, and are then pushed to an internal\ncontainer registry (provided by OpenShift). From there, they can be pulled and run\nin the cluster immediately. \n By creating a BuildConfig object, developers can thus point to a Git repo and not\nworry about building container images. Developers have almost no need to know\nanything about containers. Once the ops team deploys an OpenShift cluster and\ngives developers access to it, those developers can develop their code, commit, and\npush it to a Git repo, the same way they used to before we started packaging apps into\ncontainers. Then OpenShift takes care of building, deploying, and managing apps\nfrom that code.\nAUTOMATICALLY DEPLOYING NEWLY BUILT IMAGES WITH DEPLOYMENTCONFIGS\nOnce a new container image is built, it can also automatically be deployed in the clus-\nter. This is enabled by creating a DeploymentConfig object and pointing it to an\nImageStream. As the name suggests, an ImageStream is a stream of images. When an\nimage is built, it\u2019s added to the ImageStream. This enables the DeploymentConfig to\nnotice the newly built image and allows it to take action and initiate a rollout of the\nnew image (see figure 18.9).\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "529\nPlatforms built on top of Kubernetes\nto be processed. To process a template, you supply the values for the template\u2019s\nparameters and then OpenShift replaces the references to the parameters with those\nvalues. The result is a processed template, which is exactly like a Kubernetes resource\nlist that can then be created with a single POST request.\n OpenShift provides a long list of pre-fabricated templates that allow users to\nquickly run complex applications by specifying a few arguments (or none at all, if the\ntemplate provides good defaults for those arguments). For example, a template can\nenable the creation of all the Kubernetes resources necessary to run a Java EE appli-\ncation inside an Application Server, which connects to a back-end database, also\ndeployed as part of that same template.

It has also deployed the kube-\nproxy, making Kubernetes services available from the master node. \nB.2.1\nUnderstanding how kubeadm runs the components\nAll these components are running as containers. You can use the docker ps command\nto confirm this. But kubeadm doesn\u2019t use Docker directly to run them. It deploys their\nYAML descriptors to the /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory. This directory is moni-\ntored by the Kubelet, which then runs these components through Docker. The com-\nponents run as Pods. You can see them with the kubectl get command.

The replicas are kept in sync with the original federated\nversions. But the synchronization is one-directional only\u2014from the federation server\ndown to the underlying clusters. If you modify the resource in an underlying cluster,\nthe changes will not be synced up to the Federation API server.\n For example, if you create a namespace in the federated API server, a namespace\nwith the same name will be created in all underlying clusters. If you then create a fed-\nerated ConfigMap inside that namespace, a ConfigMap with that exact name and con-\ntents will be created in all underlying clusters, in the same namespace. This also applies\nto Secrets, Services, and DaemonSets.\n ReplicaSets and Deployments are different. They aren\u2019t blindly copied to the\nunderlying clusters, because that\u2019s not what the user usually wants. After all, if you cre-\nate a Deployment with a desired replica count of 10, you probably don\u2019t want 10 pod\nreplicas running in each underlying cluster. You want 10 replicas in total. Because of\nthis, when you specify a desired replica count in a Deployment or ReplicaSet, the Fed-\neration controllers create underlying Deployments/ReplicaSets so that the sum of\ntheir desired replica counts equals the desired replica count specified in the federated\nDeployment or ReplicaSet. By default, the replicas are spread evenly across the clus-\nters, but this can be overridden.\nNOTE\nCurrently, you need to connect to each cluster\u2019s API server individu-\nally to get the list of pods running in that cluster. You can\u2019t list all the clusters\u2019\npods through the Federated API server.\nA federated Ingress resource, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t result in the creation of any\nIngress objects in the underlying clusters. You may remember from chapter 5 that an\nIngress represents a single point of entry for external clients to a Service. Because of\nthis, a federated Ingress resource creates a global, multi-cluster-wide entry point to the\nServices across all underlying clusters. \nNOTE\nAs for regular Ingresses, a federated Ingress controller is required\nfor this. \nSetting up federated Kubernetes clusters is outside the scope of this book, so you can\nlearn more about the subject by referring to the Cluster Federation sections in the\nuser and administration guides in the Kubernetes online documentation at http:/\n/\nkubernetes.io/docs/.\n \n", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "559\nUnderstanding federated API objects\nD.3.2\nUnderstanding what federated resources do\nFor part of the federated objects, when you create the object in the Federation API\nserver, the controllers running in the Federation Controller Manager will create regu-\nlar cluster-scoped resources in all underlying Kubernetes clusters and manage them\nuntil the federated object is deleted. \n For certain federated resource types, the resources created in the underlying clus-\nters are exact replicas of the federated resource; for others, they\u2019re slightly modified\nversions, whereas certain federated resources don\u2019t cause anything to be created in\nthe underlying clusters at all.
